> I compile a table and discussion of all known arrests and prosecutions related to English-language Tor-Bitcoin darknet markets (DNMs) such as Silk Road 1, primarily 2011-2015, along with discussion of how they came to be arrested.

Online DNM users have been arrested in a number of countries, for many different reasons, and dating back to not long after the opening of Silk Road 1 in January 2011.
Because of the novelty of such markets and the relatively durable communities, a surprising number of arrests eventually become known.
While we'll never know all the users who experience imperial entanglements, published reports at least yield a lower bound on their numbers and are enlightening as to law enforcement methods & OPSEC lessons.

For information on the markets themselves (active & past), see [DNM survival](/DNM survival); for discussion of the ordering process, economics, cryptography, and politics of the black-, see [Silk Road](/Silk Road).

The sections are split up by market, then by country.

To suggest or correct entries, you can contact me [via email & PGP](/Links#contact), in the comments section, or make [an edit on Github](https://github.com/gwern/gwern.net/blob/master/DNM%20arrests.page).

<!-- Ideas for a future logistic regression:
- buyer vs seller
- number of transactions
- country-level predictors
- domestic vs international packages

<!-- estimating risk: how many sellers, buyers, transactions?
If you're curious, you could look at known sales/users numbers for SR1 and try to extrapolate some good guesses, from the Ulbricht indictment and from Christin's paper https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/publications/Christin-WWW13.pdf

The indictment/complaint says that Feb 2011 - July 2013, there were 957k total accounts, 1.229m transactions from 147k buyer accounts, 9.5m btc sales volume; Christin says among other things that "Over the measurement interval February 3, 2012- July 24, 2012, we indeed found 1,239 distinct sellers".

> Silk Road was an online black market of unprecedented scope. By the time it was shuttered in October 2013, over 13,000 offerings were listed on its homepage for illegal drugs of every conceivable variety. (PSR ¶ 25; GX- 910). A wide variety of other illicit goods and services were sold on the site as well, including fake IDs and passports, computer-hacking tools and services, counterfeit goods and pirated media, criminal guidebooks and instruction manuals, and money laundering services. (PSR ¶¶ 29, 32, 34; see also Ex. A (sample screenshots)). 1 In total, over 1.5 million transactions were conducted over Silk Road, involving over 100,000 buyer accounts and nearly 4,000 seller accounts. (PSR ¶ 59). Those transactions had a total value of nearly $214 million in U.S. currency. (Id.) Nearly 95% of those sales were for illegal drugs - including at least $8.9 million in sales of heroin, $17.3 million in sales of cocaine, and $8.1 million in sales of methamphetamine. (Id.) The buyers and sellers involved in these transactions were spread across the world, from Argentina to Australia, from the United States to the Ukraine. (Id.; GX-940F; GX-940-G).

GX-940.pdf: https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/3a2xqp/sr1_sales_data_6_feb_2011_2_oct_2013/
/docs/src/gx-940-sr1salesdata-060211-02102013.csv
1530252 sales total

let's see. there's 59 known SR1 buyer arrests. 10x to 590. there were 1530252 sales total, so 1 inferred arrest per 2593 purchases

I haven't finished compiling into a table, but let's say that for SR1 there were >30 seller arrests, and SR1 lasted from February 2011 to September 2013 (counting only full months) or 32 months. Then there were 2336 unique sellers (73*32) of which >30 were arrested for a risk of >0.012 or >1.3%.

Similarly, if there were >60 buyer arrests (I double because there seem to be more buyer arrests than seller arrests, they just tend to take plea deals and not be publicized), then the same calculation would go there are 163200 buyers of which >60 were arrested for a risk of >0.04%

<!-- Silkkitie/Valhalla arrests https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/11/29/the-idealistic-motives-behind-valhalla/
> According to the Finnish Customs, darknet drug shipments from abroad have increased by dozens of percents a year, over a few years period. That's why the surveillance has been increased. There have been results, too. In October Customs told that it had caught a Finnish reseller ordering from darknet. A young man living in Helsinki metropolitan area got caught after purchasing 900 LSD blotters from the UK that were meant for resale. During the last summer the man had already sold on Valhalla, back then Silkkitie, in small batches about 1700 LSD blotters and 600 ecstasy pills. Customs have also managed to uncover drug dealers in few other networks. A week ago Helsinki police department announced catching another darknet drug vendor, who the police is currently suspecting from a felony drug crime.

- Role: buyer, seller, staff, or market founder/operator; each has distinct risks and LE interest and should be distinguished
- Market: the DNM a person was most affiliated with, last active on, or busted because of

    For example, a Silk Road 1 employee working at Silk Road 2 would be classified as SR1-related because he had provided DPR1 his dox and was busted as a consequence of SR1, not because he worked at SR2 when he was arrested; oppositely, a seller like California Cannabis, who had sold on SR1 but was busted after being deanonymized by the undercover agent through the SR2 seller portal, would be classified as SR2-related. And a seller who sold on a market but was busted through his own off-market sales will be marked with the relevant market.
- Product: the main 3-4 drugs they were dealing in or possessed
- International: whether they were receiving/sending packages across borders
- Arrest date: best known guess at when they were raided/searched/arrested/charged; if known only to the month, I round up/down
- Known date: when I learned of it/added to my article (distribution of lags may be useful for estimating fraction remaining unknown)
- Sex: when known
- Age: age when arrested; if only a range is known, I choose the median & give the range in the notes

He apparently was known for guns before poisons, so I've marked that as what he sold.

These seem to be mostly XK customers. I include a row for each such case.

## Agora
### Australia

4 Australians [were arrested for](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2015/may/four-australians-charged-in-international-illegal-firearm-sting) [trying to buy guns](http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/dark-web-guns-bust-over-a-dozen-arrested-in-undercover-operation) from US LE-controlled seller "weaponsguy" February - March 2015, searches also turning up "Four illegal firearms, ammunition, two clandestine laboratories, precursor chemicals, methamphetamines, pseudoephedrine, steroids".
One of these was 26yo Auckland man Buddy Lipczynski was [arrested ~27 February 2015](http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/worldwide-firearms-trade-bust/2639763/ "Gladstone man arrested in worldwide firearms bust") as part of the US "weaponsguy" sting; while out on bail, around [January 2016 he was re-arrested](http://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/ice-gun-accused-in-bible-studies/2915449/ "Drugs and guns 'dark web' accused refused bail") for possession of "methylamphetamine" (presumably methamphetamine).

<!-- https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3623m0/complaintwarning_australian_vendor_i_dont_know_is/ 'i_dont_know' was one of the 4 and the account has been flipped? -->

### Denmark

A longtime steroids vendor "Diamonddweller" (active on [SR1](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/1929a34c8c.htm), SR2, Evolution, and finally Agora) sold a variety of substances sourced from the "Diamond Pharma" underground lab (shipping from somewhere in the eastern EU), but went silent (including [his Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/Diamonddweller)) around March 2015.
A Redditor who has dealt with them [claims](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/34z5xi/list_of_known_dnm_arrests/cr2de2t) it was a team of 2 men, that the Diamond Pharma website is likewise silent, and they sometimes wrote in Danish.
On 12 March 2015, Danish police announced [a historic](http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/anden_sport/danmarkshistoriens-stoerste-dopingsag-et-ton-steroider-fundet/5479263 "Danmarkshistoriens største dopingsag: Et ton steroider fundet; Betjente har fundet over et ton steroider et sted i omegnen af København") [arrest of 2](http://politiken.dk/sport/ECE2585439/danmarkshistoriens-stoerste-dopingsag-betjente-finder-over-et-ton-steroider/ "Danmarkshistoriens største dopingsag: Betjente finder over et ton steroider: Kæmpefangst af doping er et direkte resultat af en ny, strammere lov.") [men in Copenhagen](http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/politiretsvaesen/ECE7542044/To+m%C3%A6nd+afsl%C3%B8ret+med+over+et+ton+doping/ " To mænd afsløret med over et ton doping: I stor dopingaktion slog politiet til flere steder på Sjælland. Bagmænd risikerer op til seks års fængsel") with searches turning up anywhere up to 1000kg of substances, the end-result of an investigation sparked by customs intercepts of packages shipping out internationally in September 2014 to meet "an extensive illegal trade of anabolic steroids on the Internet" sold on "both open and closed forums".
Given the timing and niche product and other similarities, I agree with the Redditor that this Denmark bust was highly likely Diamonddweller.

### EU

An unknown number (<10) of European buyers were arrested for buying guns from the US LE-controlled seller "weaponsguy", sometime between September 2014 & May 2015.

### Germany

<!-- Agora, Germany http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,62888.0.html http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,62888.msg11909347.html#msg11909347 realexpresshaze/expresshaze/XpressHaze busted mid-2014? andscheinend as well? and at least 4 customers searched? even into 2015 -->

On 29 January 2015, German police searched several locations & [arrested 5](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/then-the-swat-team-rolls-up-the-first-arrest-of-a-german-deepweb-arms-dealer "Then the SWAT Team Rolls Up: Was a Darknet Arms Dealer Arrested on Campus?") [Germans for gun sales](http://www.polizei.bayern.de/lka/news/presse/aktuell/index.html/214987 "Durchsuchungen und Festnahmen wegen illegalem Waffenhandel") (especially for machine gun sales); a [media article](http://www.infranken.de/regional/schweinfurt/SEK-Einsatz-an-FH-Schweinfurt-Die-Vergangenheit-des-Waffennarren;art221,942669 "SEK-Einsatz an FH Schweinfurt: Die Vergangenheit des Waffennarren; Der 25-jährige Student, der in der vergangenen Woche an der Schweinfurter Fachhochschule von einen Sondereinsatzkommando festgenommen wurde, war der Polizei kein Unbekannter") focusing on one of them mentions his appearance in a Vice documentary about Internet sales of guns over presumably the DNMs.
(It's unclear if or how the other 4 are involved.)
The next day the Agora gun (and auto/semi-auto gun) seller Dosensuppe went on vacation, leading to [questions on the Agora forums](http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,58397.0/ "Dosensuppe BUSTED") about whether he, MaxMustermann or PROJEKTIL was the arrested man.
Dosensuppe [replied on 11 March 2015](http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,58397.msg8640671.html#msg8640671) that he had not been arrested but was going on vacation for his personal safety; he did not respond to requests for a PGP signature or posted or sold since.
Given the Vice connection and the rash of German/Dutch arrests 2014-2015, it seems highly likely that this was either Agora or Evolution associated, and of the few gun sellers, Dosensuppe fits the best.
Confirmation of [32yo man Christian L's arrest in October 2015](http://www.thelocal.de/20160729/german-darknet-weapons-dealer-sentenced-to-5-years-jail "Five years' jail for German darknet weapons dealer") came later, for selling ~65 weapons, and was sentenced to 5.5 years jail; his arrest stemmed from a November 2014 Customs intercept of a gun order at an airport and, presumably, backtracing.

### India

On 6 August 2015, 3 Indian men (J Manikantan, Debyendu Roy, Jag Saipravesh) [were arrested after a police informant bought from them](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Peddlers-procure-narcotics-from-darknet/articleshow/48368502.cms "Peddlers procuring narcotics from dark world of internet") drugs ("Ecstasy, LSD, charas and ganja") which they had purchased on Agora and were selling to "students of reputed engineering colleges in the city".

### Ireland

On 26 August 2015, two Irish men, Richard Sinclair & Kyle Hall, were raided, turning up MDMA/marijuana/diazepam/LSD and customer records of >£204,000 in sales, and other items.
Sinclair turned out to be the former SR2/TMG/Agora seller "JerseyCow", who had officially retired some time previously but had apparently resumed direct-dealing of MDMA with a few old customers in England with stealthed jigsaw puzzles; Hall was in a quasi-partnership with Sinclair as the seller "No1Benzos".

The Dutch SR1/SR2/Agora LSD/MDMA/ketamine seller "HollandOnline" was arrested [26 December 2014](https://www.om.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/@88570/aanhoudingen/ "Aanhoudingen voor grootschalige drugshandel op ondergrondse marktplaatsen") ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/animemusic/comments/2zqcwx/%E3%83%90%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%83%96%E3%83%90%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB_ogre_you_asshole_%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9A%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%83%80%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3ost2_boobies/cplw7ow)) a policeman (possibly part of the ongoing investigation of HollandOnline by Dutch police) observed a drug transfer between two men, one of was HollandOnline from Ijmuiden.
Then later, on 9 March 2015, the other man (likely HollandOnline's supplier) and a business partner of his (the Amsterdam & Utrecht men) were also arrested.

### Sweden
Two men, aged 42 and 25, were behind the vendor alias ErKran. They vended on Agora, Evolution, Valhalla and allegedly on Flugsvamp and Nucleus too. According to [an article](http://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-07-15/atal-for-storskalig-narkotikahandel) ([english translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sydsvenskan.se%2F2016-07-15%2Fatal-for-storskalig-narkotikahandel&edit-text=&act=url)), Swedish Customs discovered packages heading into the country that contained significant quantities of drugs. The initial package was seized and they proceeded to notify the police, who then started to discover that many packages were going to multiple addresses throughout Gothenburg. Each package was addressed to a non-existent company in industrial areas where ErKran was able to easily pick them up. After police discovered which address was used most frequently, a sting operation was set in motion. When the 42-year-old man showed up to empty the mailbox, he got arrested. Police claim he was carrying 160,000 Sek ($18,652 USD), a handgun and a small quantity of drugs. A 25-year-old male was then picked up and taken in to questioning where it was discovered that their operation had been running from a warehouse outside Gothenburg. Inside the warehouse police found and seized computers, drugs, packaging materials and an automatic weapon. With the seized computers as evidence, investigators learned about their online vendor alias ErKran. The 42-year-old is also implicated in another case in Sweden where school-kids on a forest excursion stumbled upon a cache of drugs. The teacher notified the police who, at the time, were apparently unable to link anyone to the crime. Apparently the 42-year-old is a suspect in that matter now.

### Uganda

On 11 December 2014, the American [Ryan Andrew Gustafson was arrested in Uganda](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2014/12/18/us/ap-us-counterfeiting-uganda.html "Feds: Uganda-Based Man Counterfeited $2M in Cash") for counterfeiting money ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-charges-filed-against-us-citizen-connection-multi-million-dollar-international-cyber); [complaint](/docs/sr/2014-12-17-agora-willyclock-complaint.pdf); [docket](/docs/sr/2014-12-22-pacer-willyclock.maff); [Agora forums](http://lacbzxobeprssrfx.onion/index.php/topic,15752.msg3148560.html#msg3148560)); he was the seller "Willy.Clock" who had sold on Evolution until banned and then Agora & his own site.
He had been uncovered after an American user of his counterfeit currency was detected, the packages sent by Willy.Clock profiled, his fingerprints found, the reshipper located in Uganda, and then an undercover deal set up; he was [deported from Uganda to the USA on 3 December 2015](https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2015/u.s.-citizen-deported-from-uganda-to-face-counterfeiting-charges-in-western-pennsylvania "U.S. Citizen Deported from Uganda to Face Counterfeiting Charges in Western Pennsylvania") to face trial in the USA as well.
In addition to Gustafson, Zackary L. Ruiz ("Mr. Mouse"), Jeremy J. Miller ("Sinner") and Michael Q. Lin ("Mlin"/"Mr. Casino") were also arrested in the USA.

### UK

[35yo Perth man Steven Kennedy](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/02/09/horticultural-student-in-perth-caught-ordering-cannabis-from-canada/ "Perth man ordered cannabis from Canada") was arrested around 5 September 2014 when an order of marijuana from Canada was intercepted by Customs; after an apparent knock-and-talk, he admitted everything and pled guilty.

### UK

An unknown number of UK buyers (<10) were arrested for buying guns from the US LE-controlled seller "weaponsguy", sometime between September 2014 & May 2015.

[Jeffrey Paul Lloyd](http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Gorseinon-man/story-28084851-detail/story.html "Gorseinon man with 'apocalyptic' vision of world ending jailed for possessing illegal weapons") was arrested on [26 March 2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-34677345 "Six years jail for 'end of world' weapons Swansea man") after a search turned up a cache of weapons (knives, an axe, crossbow, pepper spray, a pipe gun, and 9mm & shotgun ammo), most or all of which had been purchased on Agora, and was sentenced to 6 years.
The tipoff was said to be that "The court heard the Metropolitan Police was monitoring the websites" and "The different details were provided to the Met Police by a seller in Germany as a customer had purchased prohibited ammunition and firearms"; it's unclear if this means that another weapons-seller on Agora was a UC, or if a seller had been arrested and kept customer details and who that seller might be (currently no weapons-associated seller arrests in Germany are known for March 2015).

### USA

In mid-2014, the Agora guns & weapon seller "weaponsguy" began receiving complaints of packages not arriving & being a scammer; in November 2014, he returned from a vacation, got the complaining buyer to vouch for him, and resumed selling guns & related equipment.
I have identified "weaponsguy" as the ATF-controlled account which did undercover sales to Justin Moreira in March-April 2015, in which case it seems likely to me that weaponsguy followed the same lifecycle as Dark_Mart and other FBI-controlled accounts on Evolution and was busted sometime around or after the complaints began, cooperated and his account began to be operated by LE (ATF in this case).
An [Australian press release](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2015/may/four-australians-charged-in-international-illegal-firearm-sting "Four Australians charged in international illegal firearm sting") writes "In September 2014, the HSI investigation led to the identification of a 33-year-old man in Montana for the operation of the online alias account...In September 2014, HSI agents commenced a covert operation using the online alias account."
(HSI, NCA, and the Australians have declined to comment on my identification of the seller as weaponsguy.)

In June 2016, the guilty plea of 35yo Kansan Michael Andrew Ryan ("Brad Jones"/"Gunrunner") was made public (case #5:15-cr-40050-DDC-1; [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/kansas-man-pleads-guilty-exporting-firearms-overseas-purchasers "Kansas Man Pleads Guilty to Exporting Firearms to Overseas Purchasers"); [indictment](/docs/sr/2016-06-07-ryan-indictment-gov.uscourts.ksd.106175.1.0.pdf); [parole charge](/docs/sr/2016-06-07-ryan-parolecomplaint.pdf); [plea agreement](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2016/images/07/05/ryan.plea.pdf); [docket](/docs/sr/2016-06-07-ryan-pacerdocket.mht)), his federal case unsealed on PACER, and sentencing scheduled for September 2016; he pled to charges from June 2015 of using 2 straw buyers, his ex-girlfriend Allison Mitchell and a Marlo Martin, to buy guns, and shipping a number of guns internationally to customers in Ireland, Scotland, & Australia, as well as possession of a firearm while on out release, and was sentenced to [52 months in January 2017](http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article129764179.html "Kansas 'Gunrunner' sentenced for illegal overseas gun sales").
Given his age, Midwest location, business, countries he sold to, and charges dating to after weaponsguy was likely busted, I identify Ryan as weaponsguy, although some aspects do not match up (for example, Ryan's initial pleas and request for jury trial, despite the presence of some sealed files on PACER, is hard to reconcile with him cooperating and turning over his Agora account to be used to entrap buyers).
The press release & indictment are unspecific about which DNM he used, or how he was caught, and the plea agreement specifies use of BMR without any mention of Agora/weaponsguy, so I could be wrong.

In January 2015, [Austin Frembling was arrested](http://www.fresnobee.com/2015/02/20/4389411/fresno-man-indicted-for-possession.html) in Fresno, California, for buying \$3k of MDMA off Agora from a Canadian seller ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/news/docs/2015/2015_02/02-19-15Frembling.html); [complaint](/docs/sr/2015-frembling-caed-03307884002.pdf); [docket](/docs/sr/2015-02-22-agora-fremblingdocket.maff); [previous record](http://mugshot-record-search.com/mugshot/CA/Fresno-County-Sheriff-Office/2013-Feb-07/4023889/BRYAN-FREMBLING)).
His package was intercepted by Customs (possibly due to inadequate stealth), then a controlled delivery was done to his PO box.

On 2015-01-30, 48yo Alabaman Michael Albert Focia ([complaint](/docs/sr/agora-focia-almd-01702438594.pdf); [media](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/tip-if-youre-selling-guns-on-the-dark-web-dont-get-your-prints-on-them "Tip: If You're Selling Guns on the Dark Web, Don't Get your Prints on Them"); [press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao-mdal/pr/montgomery-man-convicted-illegal-gun-sales-darknet-sites "Montgomery Man Convicted for Illegal Gun Sales on Darknet Sites")) was arrested for sales of firearms on BlackMarket Reloaded (as "iWorks") and Agora (as "RTBArms"); an undercover purchase by the ATF in August 2013 yielded a handgun which they traced back to the original owner, who remembered the license plates & phone number and other details of the man who he'd sold the handgun to, as well as a UPS clerk, and by November 2013 had yielded Focia's name/address/etc.
A subsequent undercover purchase from Focia on Agora yielded fingerprints on the packaging which matched fingerprints already known for Focia.
A pro se defense failed and he was convicted of most charges 19 June 2015, and was [sentenced to 4.25 years](http://www.justice.gov/usao-mdal/pr/montgomery-man-sentenced-selling-firearms-dark-web "Montgomery Man Sentenced for Selling Firearms on the Dark Web") in November 2015.
(Interestingly, Focia may have almost escaped: BMR shut down shortly after the first agent de-anonymized Focia, which stymied several other BMR investigations, and the second agent seems to not realized that the Agora seller he was investigating was the same as the earlier BMR seller until the fingerprints came back as a known match. Changing pseudonyms may interfere with investigations, but is no panacea.)

The complaint does not specify the market or seller, but [some careful searching](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/31afi7/psaarticle_hyannis_man_charged_with_bitcoin/cq3ejul) reveals that the market was Agora and the seller was highly likely to be "weaponsguy", who seemed to have been arrested and flipped possibly in November 2014, running a gun sting afterwards with several sales on Agora (but that feedback could have been padded).
The Australian press release implies that there may have been up to 9 other arrests in the USA, and narrows the date down to September 2014.

On 14 May 2015, SUNY Oswego college student Dylan C. Soeffing was [raided and arrested](http://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/05/cops_seize_809_pills_170k_in_cash_in_raid_suny_oswego_student_charged.html "Cops seize 809 pills, $170K in cash in raid; SUNY Oswego student charged") for reselling marijuana & Xanax locally he had [bought off Agora from "MoodyMayhem" & "Benzoman"](http://www.syracuse.com/crime/index.ssf/2015/05/accused_student_drug_dealer_tells_oswego_cops_hes_leaving_biz_to_focus_on_finals.html "Accused student drug dealer tells Oswego cops he left biz to focus on finals").
A [May 2016 FinCEN award to the investigators](https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/pdf/20160510.pdf "FinCEN Awards Recognize Partnership Between Law Enforcement and Financial Institutions to Fight Financial Crime") confirms that Soeffing was discovered by review of 'suspicious activity reports' filed by the banks & financial institutions he used to deposit cash into & purchase Bitcoins: "Specific banking transactions conducted by the subject were traced to the purchases of virtual  currency and then to the Dark Web market."

As part of the Willy.Clock investigation leading up to his arrest in Uganda, at least [3 Americans were indicted on 1 April 2015](https://www.fbi.gov/pittsburgh/press-releases/2015/four-charged-in-international-uganda-based-cyber-counterfeiting-scheme "Four Charged in International Uganda-Based Cyber Counterfeiting Scheme"):
Zackary L. Ruiz ("Mr. Mouse") of Nevada, Jeremy J. Miller ("Sinner") of Washington, and Michael Q. Lin ("Mlin"/"Mr. Casino") of Pennsylvania.
They seem to have worked with Willy.Clock or been part of his non-DNM private forums and so are not DNM arrests.

19/20yo Washington men Boden Gregory Bridge & Tristan Simpson Brennand were [arrested in December 2015](http://komonews.com/news/local/indictment-washington-teen-drug-dealers-thrived-on-darknet "Indictment: Washington teen drug dealers thrived on 'darknet'") (PACER: `2:15-cr-00384`; [docket](https://www.unitedstatescourts.org/federal/wawd/224355/)); an informant reported about Brennand selling on Agora & Evolution after importing from Germany & India, leading to intercepts of some of the DNM sales and eventually the arrests.

## AlphaBay
### Austria

Sometime in October 2015, the [31yo male Viennese AlphaBay seller "ShanSa" was arrested in Austria](http://derstandard.at/2000034526427/Wiener-Dealer-betrieb-internationalen-Drogenversand-im-Internet "Wiener Dealer betrieb internationalen Drogenversand im Internet: Über Darknet-Plattform AlphaBay - 31-Jähriger verschickte Suchtgift auch nach Indien und Australien"); the search turned up records of 182 international & 73 Austrian sales, amphetamine/MDMA/cocaine/LSD/RCs/tablet machine.

### USA

38yo Californian man David Ryan Burchard ("CaliConnect"/"the\_real\_caliconnect"/"caliconnect4life"), a major marijuana & cocaine on SR1 (DoJ claims >\$1.4m in sales based on the SR1 server image[^CaliConnect-sales]) and then Agora, Nucleus, Abraxas, and AlphaBay, was raided 21 January 2016 and arrested 28 March 2016 ([press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/merced-man-arrested-distributing-marijuana-and-cocaine-nationwide-through-silk-road-and "Merced Man Arrested for Distributing Marijuana and Cocaine Nationwide Through the Silk Road and Other Dark-Web Marketplace Websites"); [complaint](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/file/836576/download)), following an investigation starting March 2015 into the large number of bitcoins he had been selling to an "unlicensed digital currency exchanger" (possibly another SR1 user named "fishing01") which, after tracking devices monitored him dropping off packages & unencrypted PMs contained tracking numbers from the SR1 server image was further linked to his area, was combined with an earlier postal investigation into an undeliverable package which was opened & contained marijuana and Burchard's packages were intercepted; the unencrypted SR1 PMs further indicated that CaliConnect was using MoneyPak and gave the transaction IDs of several, one of which MoneyPak & AccountNow subpoenas revealed was paid to David Burchard, and had sent his personal information unencrypted to a SR1 seller of fake IDs and a benzo seller. This was followed up by a undercover purchase on AlphaBay (Burchard's primary market in 2016) & surveillance of Burchard mailing it.
After the raid, several of Burchard's computer records were decrypted by trying a password he reused on a subpoenaed website, revealing at least 49 buyer records.[^CaliConnect-password]

[^CaliConnect-sales]: pg10 of CaliConnect complaint:

    > As part of the investigation, the FBI was able to seize information about vendors on the Silk Road, which has since been made available to law enforcement.  27. The Silk Road NTC Vendor List, referenced above, contained a list of vendors on Silk Road with over \$100,000.00 in sales, compiled from information on computing servers that were seized by law enforcement during the investigation into Silk Road.  Included in this document was the vendor name "caliconnect."  "Caliconnect" was described as a marijuana trafficker with a sales volume at approximately \$1,250,248.65.  "Caliconnect" is listed on the NTC Vendor List as the one of the largest vendors on the Silk Road.The FBI estimates that "caliconnect" was the eighteenth largest vendor worldwide out of the approximately 4,000 vendors who sold goods on the Silk Road.As such, this information indicated that BURCHARD was likely a large-scale vendor on the Silk Road utilizing the vendor name "Caliconnect."  I requested additional data from the seized Silk Road servers pertaining to "Caliconnect."  I received this information on June 11, 2015and began to review it (as described below)
[^CaliConnect-password]: pg25:

    > CFA Solorio provided me with decrypted messages found on BURCHARD's thumb drive. BURCHARD used a program called GPG4USB, which automatically used Burchard's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) private key to decrypt messages sent to him from customers. The GPG4USB program required a password to decrypt messages. CFA Solorio discovered that "asshole209" was the password, which was a password utilized by BURCHARD based on subpoenaed records obtained by me...I noted approximately 49 orders within the decrypted messages from customers who were  buying marijuana from BURCHARD.


35yo Minnesotan man Aaron James Glende ("IcyEagle") was [raided 11 March 2016 based on USPS information](http://www.winonadailynews.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/federal-charges-winona-man-tried-to-sell-stolen-bank-account/article_965a0cf7-3390-5217-b8ae-c3a578dc50fa.html "Federal charges: Winona man tried to sell stolen bank account info online"), turning up Xanax & cash & "other prescriptions" (charged with Xanax, oxycodone, amphetamine, diazepam, and marijuana); the local Minnesota case was apparently promoted to the federal level as the fully sealed case 1:16-mj-366.
In July 2016, charges in another (apparently unrelated?) case were filed in Georgia based on an undercover agent purchase of bank account information from IcyEagle (case gandce 1:2016-cr-00239; [press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndga/pr/icyeagle-dark-web-vendor-stolen-information-charged-atlanta "ICYEAGLE, a Dark Web Vendor of Stolen Information, Charged in Atlanta"); [indictment](/docs/sr/2016-07-26-icyeagle-indictment-gov.uscourts.gand.228648.15.0.pdf)) but he had already been arrested.
Neither the press release nor indictment specifies how an undercover purchase of digital information could possibly lead to his deanonymization or arrest, and the majority of documents in that case as well as the complaint have been sealed.
(I wonder what the connection between the cases is, why Glende was still selling even after his raid, and what all the sealing is about in his case?)

26yo South Florida man Chrissano S. Leslie ("Owlcity"), who sold fentanyl, alpha-PVP, MDMA, cocaine & Xanax, was [raided & arrested 27 July 2016](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article92352412.html "DEA: South Florida 'dark web' dealer sold deadly heroin from China") ([complaint](https://ia601508.us.archive.org/4/items/gov.uscourts.flsd.489660/gov.uscourts.flsd.489660.1.0.pdf)).
The DEA had made a number of undercover buys which were mailed from south Florida, and de-anonymized Owlcity when he checked the USPS.com tracking number of one of the undercover orders, revealing his IP to the USPS: "On February 26, 2016, DEA agents received information from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) that the tracking status of the Priority Mail package that OWLCITY sent to complete the October 23, 2015 heroin order was queried online on the U.S. Postal Service website from an IP address assigned by AT&T to an account associated with the Leslie Residence."
After that, they began in-person surveillance of Leslie, watching him drive to the post office with additional orders & intercepted the packages, ISP monitoring of Tor activity, correlation of Owlcity inactivity with computer repair, and finally a raid 27 July 2016.

On 2 August 2016, Pakistani & Yemeni men Abdullah Almashwali (31) and Chaudhry Ahmed Farooq (24) were arrested in NY for selling cocaine & heroin on Alphabay ([although](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/08/12/feds-indict-two-alphabay-vendors-distribution-conspiracy-charges/) they'd also sold on Dream, Oasis, Nucleus & Agora) as the sellers "Area51"/"DarkApollo" ([complaint](https://regmedia.co.uk/2016/08/12/almashwali_arrest.pdf), [press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/two-brooklyn-men-indicted-distributing-heroin-and-cocaine-dark-web-marketplace-alphabay "Two Brooklyn Men Indicted for Distributing Heroin and Cocaine on Dark Web Marketplace Alphabay"), [media](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/08/12/two_indicted_for_heroin_and_coke_sales_on_alphabay_dark_web_forum/ "Post-Silk Road, Feds bust chaps for 'dealing heroin, coke' on world's largest dark web souk: Whack-a-mole against online drug sales continues"))
An investigation starting March 2016 began with their PGP keys whose metadata used a nickname that led to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts; subpoenas turned up Farooq's real name although he was already under investigation by the DEA (detailed are sealed/redacted due to use of a "confidential source"). Some undercover purchases on AB found they reused a Brooklyn return address, LE lifted fingerprints from the package, and the packages' postage had been paid for from postage kiosks which take credit cards & photographs of buyers (see also "MDpro") and the mail cover database turned up further packages linked to them (likely searching for other packages using the same return address & checking postage purchase records again).

50yo Texan man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested on 16 September 2016 in a controlled delivery after trying to buy explosives off an undercover FBI seller on Alphabay ([press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/houston-man-arrested-attempting-transport-and-use-explosives "Houston Man Arrested for Attempting to Transport and Use Explosives"); [complaint](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3110840/Complaint-against-Cary-Ogborn-Alleged-Dark-Web.pdf); media: [1](https://motherboard.vice.com/read/undercover-fbi-agent-busts-alleged-explosives-buyer-on-the-dark-web "Undercover FBI Agent Busts Alleged Explosives Buyer on the Dark Web"), [2](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/texas-man-arrested-dark-web-attempt-buy-explosives-article-1.2800015)); worsening his troubles, he communicated with the undercover agent using a clearnet email account linked to his name & IP.

Emil Vladimirov Babadjov (31) was arrested on 9 December 2016 for selling fentanyl and heroin on Alphabay and Dream ([complaint](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/press-release/file/918811/download), [press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edca/pr/fentanyl-and-heroin-sold-dark-web-marketplace)). He also had a profile on Valhalla but it is unclear whether he was the one that created and controlled it, since it has listed a different public PGP key and Valhalla is known to allow vendor impostors. The main investigation started in September 2016 when his PGP key's metadata led the agents to his Facebook and Coinbase account. A subpoena to Coinbase then revealed his real name and the agents started making orders from the Blime-Sub vendor account on Alphabay. Due to the Postage Validation Imprinter (PVI) a US postal inspector was able to see that the postage for one parcel was bought on 18 September 2016 via a Self-Service Kiosk (SSK) near Babadjov's known address. The man on the photo that was taken by the SSK system during the transaction was identified as Emil Babadjov according to the drivers license and social media photos of Babadjov. On 16 November 2016, the agents received another response from the DEA western regional lab that stated that two fingerprints belonging to Babadjov were found on the exterior of a parcel that they ordered in an UC purchase. More details to the bust [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/5lo7ir/2_more_juicy_vendor_busts_and_what_they_did_wrong/).

Ted Khleborod (28) and Ana Barrero (24) were arrested on April 26, 2017 for selling U-47700. Law enforcement started investigating Peter the Great when a customer of him overdosed. They found out that the overdosed customer (Aisha Zughbieh-Collins) bought from him due to bad OpSec on her side. After they did a test-purchase from the vendor, they got an email address used for purchasing the shipping label for the sent package. A subpoena to that email provider turned up the vendor's real name (Ted Khleborod). He and his girlfriend (Ana Barrero) were put under surveillance for three days and she was seen dropping off dozens of parcels with labels matching those of the law enforcement test-purchase. Then they got arrested.

## Black Market Reloaded
### Germany/Netherlands

See the Utopia section.

### Israel

On ~8 January 2014, the [Israeli man Amit Sand was arrested for buying a gun](http://posta.co.il/index.php/widgetkit/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D-2/%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%91/1604-%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%97-%D7%94%D7%93%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%98-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9F "אקדח הדארקנט הראשון: בחבילה שהגיעה לסניף דואר בתל אביב התגלה אקדח מפורק שהוסלק בתוך מגף * מזמין החבילה הודה כי רכש את האקדח ברשת האינטרנט הסודית באמצעות המטבע הדיגיטלי ביטקוין, ובמשטרה תוהים: האם נחשפה דרך חדשה להברחת אמצעי לחימה לישראל?") off a DNM seller for ~\$1550 in bitcoins; the first package of parts (mailed 18 December 2013) was discovered by Customs and allowed to go through, and he was arrested after picking up the final second package.
I assign this buy to BMR, since while BMR had closed a week or two before the first package was mailed, the deal could have been agreed upon earlier, and no other major market allowed guns at the time; this may be like the Korff case, where the purchase (ricin, in his case) began on BMR but continued off-market after BMR closed.

### USA

In August 2013, the ATF did an undercover gun purchase from the BMR seller "iWorks" and by November 2013 had identified iWorks as Michael Albert Focia; possibly due to the BMR shut down, he was not arrested until January 2015 after a second undercover purchase on Agora from Focia's new pseudonym, "RTBArms".
See the Agora section for details of his case.

Around 10 September 2013, [Adam Bunger was arrested in Kentucky](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/international-gun-sales-in-xbox-864321 "ATF Probe Nabs Gun Seller On Shadowy Darknet: Overseas-bound arms hidden in Xbox, DVD consoles") for multiple international gun sales on BMR as [likely the seller "Grass4Cash"](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/dark-web-black-market-reloaded-adam-bunger-gun-sales-arrest/ "Cops may have just busted a major illegal gun dealer from the Deep Web") ([complaint](/docs/sr/bmr-adambunger-complaint.pdf); #1:13-cr-00037-JHM-HBB-1); he eventually [pled guilty](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdky/pr/bowling-green-kentucky-man-guilty-shipping-firearms-internationally "Bowling Green, Kentucky, Man Guilty Of Shipping Firearms Internationally - Firearms were secreted inside video game systems for shipment to foreign addresses") and was [sentenced to 2 years](http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/Bunger-Sentenced-After-Sending-Firearms-Overseas-270832621.html "Bunger Sentenced After Sending Firearms Overseas").
His case began 28 June 2013 when Australian Customs intercepted a gun shipment; the recipient was arrested & he cooperated, and the packages backtracked a post office in Kentucky, and the postal clerk identified Bunger.

On 6 November 2013, the BMR gun dealer Matthew Crisafi ("Gun Wise") [was arrested](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/11/07/sting-operation-nabs-alleged-online-arms-dealer-via-silk-road-competitor-site/ "Sting Operation Nabs Alleged Online Arms Dealer On Silk Road Competitor Site") ([complaint](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nj/Press/files/pdffiles/2013/Crisafi,%20Matthew%20Complaint.pdf); [press](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nj/Press/files/Crisafi,%20Matthew%20Complaint.html) [release](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/new-hampshire-man-arrested-charged-nj-illegal-weapons-sales-underground-online)), ultimately [pleading guilty](http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20140507/News/140509786 "Hampton man to plead guilty to trafficking firearms online: A Hampton man accused of illegally trafficking firearms overseas on an underground, Internet-based marketplace known as "Black Market Reloaded", has agreed to plead guilty to the crime in federal court."); a series of undercover buys appears to have identified him by interviewing local post office employees, followed up by additional confirmation from a gun purchase where Crisafi accepted Western Union payment (he didn't receive the WU himself, a 'co-conspirator' did, but they then turned it into postal money orders for Matthew Crisafi).

The closure of BMR in December 2013 did not end investigations into users, and the FBI was able to make 4 inter-connected busts related to BMR's poison sellers.
The first bust was [Jesse](http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/criminal/labelle-man-accused-of-selling-toxin-in-death-plot/2162117 "LaBelle man accused of selling deadly toxin") [William](http://www.nbc-2.com/story/24506383/muse-poison-black-market-reloaded-online-jesse-korff-labelle-abrin "SWFL man charged with selling poison in online black market") [Korff](https://web.archive.org/web/20150330195115/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11404486 "Florida man who produced and sold deadly ricin gets prison") ([complaint](/docs/sr/bmr-korff-complaint.pdf)), BMR seller "Snowman840", who was arrested 18 January 2014; an FBI undercover agent had ordered ricin from him, beginning on BMR and then off-market after it closed, and they arranged a dead drop in Florida - except the location was specified *in advance*, so they were able to surveil Korff dropping the ricin off personally.
Korff and his laptop yielded information about a sale of purified nicotine oil to to Ryan Kelly Chamberlain and to Kuntal Patel.

[Kuntal Patel](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-29331457 "'Breaking Bad' inspired poison accused 'wished mother was dead'") was a UK woman who had bought abrin [from Korff](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/11136008/US-teenager-was-behind-deadly-substance-in-Breaking-Bad-poison-case.html "US teenager was behind deadly substance in 'Breaking Bad' poison case: Jesse Korff sent Kuntal Patel the deadly poison Abrin which he had made in his home-based lab") to kill her mother (the attempt apparently failed because abrin is much less deadly ingested than inhaled); information from Korff led to her being arrested 26 January 2014, and she ultimately received [3 years](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2825778/Graphic-designer-inspired-Breaking-Bad-fantasise-poisoning-mother-jailed-three-years-possession-deadly-toxin.html "Graphic designer who was inspired by Breaking Bad to fantasise about poisoning her mother jailed for three years for possession of deadly toxin")

The next bust was in NYC: [the Swedish man Jonathan Norling turned himself in](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/nypd-reach-fbi-interpol-cyanide-carrying-swede-article-1.1637056 "NYPD reach out to FBI, Interpol over cyanide-carrying mystery Swede - his young wife says she never knew: Jonathan Norling, 22, had more of the toxin and a suicide note in his Cadillac; another poison, abrin, in his Bronx apartment - and a 9-mm. pistol and an AR-15 assault rifle in his rented U-Haul truck. His wife and their young daughter, also living in the apartment, were unharmed. His wife, Mbene Ndiayem, was stunned by his behavior and arrest, says her father, adding, 'I see her crying all the time.'") at a police station with cyanide & abrin; the police chose to arrest him & charge him.
Norling cooperated, and the mail records of his order led them to his BMR seller, James Christopher Malcolm, who, during the same post office visit he had mailed Norling's order, had also mailed off an order to Ryan Kelly Chamberlain.

James Christopher Malcolm ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/cae/news/docs/2014/2014_06/06-05-14Malcolm.html); [complaint](/docs/sr/bmr-jameschristophermalcolm.pdf)) [was arrested 4 May 2014](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article2598075.html "Undercover operation ends in Carmichael man's arrest on firearms, explosives charges") in California, based principally on the work of a local informant (cooperating to get leniency on pre-existing charges that seem unrelated to BMR), and the [BMR connection came up later](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article2601218.html "Carmichael man pleads not guilty in weapons case; FBI probes his connections to the 'Darknet'").

Finally, [Ryan Kelly Chamberlain was arrested 2 June 2014](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/silk-road-like-website-part-of-investigation-into-man-arrested-by-fbi-for-having-alleged-bomb-making-materials/Content?oid=2819736 "Silk Road like website part of investigation into man arrested by FBI for having alleged bomb making materials ") ([complaint](/docs/sr/bmr-ryanchamberlain-complaint.pdf)) in San Francisco, California, for possession of bomb/IED parts (despite buying from Malcolm & Korff, he apparently didn't have any poisons on hand).
His complaint details the web of interactions connecting him to Norling, Malcolm, & Korff.
(Korff → Chamberlain ← Malcolm ← Norling.)

There may be additional unknown gun-related BMR USA cases, given the roughly [June-August 2013 comments of DEA agent Carl Force to DPR1](/docs/sr/exhibit8-le_counterintel.txt) (emphasis added):

> BMR is on the radar and that is ATF's baby. Politics plays a significant role in prioritization of which agency gets to own which investigations. The climate is aggressive when it comes to weapons trafficking and with the gun control hot potato has guaranteed virtually a carte blanche to ATF. And they have deep pockets as well. Because tor based weapons traffickers are almost always running guns IRL, there is synergy between federal and state. Federal approves staggering sums of money for surveillance,undercover and CI's. I don't want to say BMR is "infiltrated", but *there are a lot of compromised accounts and there have been a few quiet busts. Nearly every bust has resulted in cooperation.* I am not sure what the long play is, but as long as this current administration is in power the gunrunners will always be hard targets. They are intimidated with the threat of tangible charges (interstate trafficking, conspiracy, organized crime, distribution) and they ALL cooperate. The general consensus is that weapons dealers are not sophisticated and have a lot of IRL visibility, so they are ALWAYS on the radar.

By August 2013, the Grass4Cash Australia buyer had been busted and the Grass4Cash investigation was largely mature, but then the next BMR gun arrest was Gun Wise in November 2013; given Force's wording, it sounds like there should be at least 2 unknown busts and many more "compromised accounts" (buyers?), indicating that at least half the cases are missing.

## Evolution
### Germany

On 2015-02-26, the 20-yo German man, the seller "Shiny Flakes" on Evolution & his clearnet site `shiny-flakes.to`, was arrested together with his Bulgarian courier/supplier

This was the culmination of [a long German police investigation into him](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-rise-and-fall-of-shiny-flakes-germanys-online-drug-market "The Rise and Fall of Shiny Flakes, Germany's Online Drug Market"), which was sparked by an undelivered package which was opened for insufficient postage bouncing to the fake return addresses, which lead to profiling of his packages, tracing them back through the postal system, surveillance of package stations and him mailing them, and finally undercover buys & seizures of additional packages.
Shiny Flakes had not purged his customers' data, and in conjunction with the profiling & intercepting of sent packages, this led to a reported total of "38 locations were searched and five other individuals were arrested" on 2015-03-10 (["38 homes of people that were on the alleged dealer's customer list"](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/germany-drug-bust-finds-4m-haul-destined-online-sale-cops-n322146)).
He was ultimately [sentenced to 7 years](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/german-teen-sold-one-tonne-of-drugs-from-his-mothers-flat "German teenager sold one tonne of drugs from his mother's flat: Boy nicknamed the 'bedroom dealer' jailed for €4m online drug business run from his apartment in Leipzig") as a juvenile.

### Sweden

On 27 March 2015, [Swedish police](https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2015/Mars/Polisen-stoppade-droghandel-pa-natet/) [announced](https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Pressmeddelanden/Vasterbotten/Polisen-stoppar-omfattande-narkotikahandel-via-Darknet/ "Polisen stoppar omfattande narkotikahandel via Darknet: Polisen har i ett framgångsrikt samarbete tillsammans med Åklagarmyndigheten stoppat en omfattande försäljning av narkotiska preparat via Darknet") that they had detained 7 or 8 suspects who were selling drugs (principally: marijuana, LSD, & MDMA) online using "Silk Road and Evolution...from 2012 onward...to recipients in Sweden and to other countries worldwide"  and arrested 4.
[6 of them were charged in June 2015](http://norran.se/nyheter/blaljus-nyheter/harifran-skotte-han-storsta-narkotikaligan-408757 "Härifrån skötte han största narkotikaligan: Härifrån skötte den 26-årige Skelleftebon Sveriges största narkotikaliga.

### UK

[On 3 November 2014](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2823411/Teenager-accused-plotting-pipe-bomb-attack-targeting-education-college.html "Teenager accused of plotting pipe bomb attack 'was targeting further education college'"), the then-18yo Newcastle man Liam Lyburd (buyer ["The Joker"/"I Love My Anger"](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3172374/Teenager-stockpiled-weapons-explosives-carry-mass-murder-former-college.html)/"Donald Trump") [was arrested](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/first-picture-teenager-accused-plotting-6124856 "Liam Lyburd: Bitter teen 'planned mass murder at college with kill bag full of weapons and explosives'") after a 2 November 2014 Facebook post threatening to carry out a mass-killing at Newcastle College was reported to police by a friend; he was [convicted 30 July 2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-33722658) and [sentenced to life in September 2015](http://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/liam-lyburd-sentenced "Teenager Jailed For Life For Planning Massacre At Newcastle College") ([overview of case](http://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/how-one-british-teenager-used-the-digital-black-ma "How A Teenager Came Within Hours Of Carrying Out A College Massacre: Liam Lyburd, from Newcastle, was today sentenced to life in prison for buying a gun, gas canisters, and pipe bomb materials from the Dark Web with intent to shoot students at his former college. BuzzFeed News follows the trail and asks whether someone in future might succeed where he failed")).
The police search turned up a handgun & ammo, 7 bombs, and other items; some of which he had ["bought using bitcoins, the decentralised internet currency, from the dark or deep web, the black market where illegal commodities are know to be traded"](http://www.theladbible.com/articles/a-guy-used-bitcoin-to-stockpile-weapons-and-ammunition-in-a-bid-to-carry-out-mass-murder-at-his-former-college "A Guy Used Bitcoin To Stockpile Weapons And Ammunition In A Bid To Carry Out Mass Murder At His Former College"), one of the markets being [Evolution](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/liam-lyburd-teen-accused-plotting-6149495 "Liam Lyburd: Bomb suspect teen 'left note blaming establishment for his miserable life'")

The Liverpool man [Mohammed Ammer Ali was arrested 11 February 2015](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2957211/British-father-two-bought-ricin-kill-hundreds-delivered-toy-car-caught-online-sting-FBI.html) after he ordered ricin from an undercover FBI account, found guilty in [July 2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-33708611), and eventually sentenced to 8 years in [September 2015](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-34288380).
Initial reports did not specify market, but given the many details consistent with it and the BMR precedent, this was obviously another case in the Evolution FBI sting using the flipped Dark\_Mart account; the use of Evolution was eventually [confirmed during the trial in July 2015](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/21/breaking-bad-style-ricin-delivery-dark-web-mohammed-ammer-ali-trial "Man ordered 'Breaking Bad-style' ricin delivery from FBI agent, court hears; Mohammed Ammer Ali denies charge of attempting to possess chemical weapon, arguing he was trying to buy poison for 'peaceful purpose'").

Two Manchester teenagers [were arrested 16 February 2015](http://www.gmp.police.uk/content/SocialTwitterFeed/A391702C29DD7E8D80257E210039C813 "Teenager admits trying to buy deadly toxin") [for](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/teenager-in-court-charged-with-trying-to-acquire-lethal-toxin-abrin-10054864.html) attempting that month to buy abrin off an unspecified DNM for suicide, after the UK police were informed in January about their negotiations for it.
The female was released immediately, and the male eventually [received a 12-month referral order](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/20/teenager-court-after-abrin-toxin-over-internet "Teenager walks free from court after trying to order lethal toxin over internet: Sixteen-year-old boy from Manchester given 12-month referral order after claiming he attempted to buy abrin to kill himself").

### USA

"In or about mid-2014" the TCF/Evolution seller "Dark_Mart" was taken over by the FBI^[See Cheng Le complaint: "In or about mid-2014, an FBI online covert employee (the 'OCE') assumed  online Dark-Web identity, which had previously been used by a trafficker in illicit materials, including, among other things, biological toxins."].
The details are unknown, but Dark_Mart rejoined the Evolution forums after a long absence spanning that period with a comment about guns bringing heat on his suppliers^[Dark_Mart last posts on Evolution 2014-03-03 normally then posts again on 2014-08-29 that "I just recently logged back into evo and contacted some of you about my status. The bottom line is that one of my suppliers got arrested on gun charges and it brought some heat on our operation. I had to go off the grid for a while but Dark_Mart is back!"], which may or may not be the FBI agent telling the truth to be safe.

Stephen & Cynthia Jones [were arrested 2 October 2014](http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=280308 "Flowery Branch couple busted on drug charges") after [a controlled delivery ("CD")](/docs/sr/2003-steffen-druginterdiction-ch10-drugparcelsystems.pdf "_Drug Interdiction Partnerships, Legal Principles, and Investigative Methodologies for Law Enforcement_: Chapter 10: 'Drug Parcel Systems'") of a package of MDMA from what may be the Evolution Dutch seller "weedybusnis" (he had many complaints of non-arriving or slow packages, suggesting his stealth is subpar or he's been profiled).

The New York carder Cheng Le (Evolution seller "FNU"/"fnufnu") [was arrested 23 December 2014](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/20/us-usa-crime-ricin-idUSKBN0KT2G020150120 "New York man charged with trying to buy ricin 'death pills' online") & convicted [August 2015](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/27/us-usa-crime-ricin-idUSKCN0QW2JE20150827 "N.Y. man convicted of trying to buy ricin 'death pills' online") & [sentenced to 16 years](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/new-york-man-sentenced-manhattan-federal-court-16-years-prison-attempting-acquire "New York Man Sentenced In Manhattan Federal Court To 16 Years In Prison For Attempting To Acquire Deadly Toxin, Ricin") after buying the poison ricin from the Evolution seller "Dark_Mart", who turned out to have been flipped "In or about mid-2014" by the FBI ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-york-man-indicted-attempting-acquire-deadly-toxin-ricin); [complaint](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/01/21/cheng_le_complaint_comp.pdf); [Evolution pages](/docs/sr/2015-02-24-evolution-chenglericin.tar.xz)).
(See also the two UK arrests in February 2015 for abrin.)

A fentanyl OD death in North Dakota (as well as several other OD deaths or incidents) triggered a complicated multi-state investigation that seems to have resulted in charges for at least 6 people involved in buying or selling fentanyl on Evolution. (Media: [1](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/03/three_od_on_dangerous_drug_smu.html "3 OD on dangerous drug in Portland jail; feds say inmate smuggled contraband inside her body"), [2](http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2015/mar/04/grand-forks-man-pleads-guilty-in-several-fentanyl-overdoses/ "Grand Forks man pleads guilty in several fentanyl overdoses"), [3](http://www.wdaz.com/news/3691219-number-defendants-charged-fentanyl-overdoses-5 "Number of Defendants Charged in Fentanyl Overdoses up to 5"), [4](http://www.valleynewslive.com/home/headlines/International-drug-network-linked-to-Grand-Forks-teens-overdose-296012701.html "International drug network linked to Grand Forks teen's overdose"), [5](http://www.wahpetondailynews.com/oregon-man-accused-of-selling-fentanyl-that-led-to-nd/article_de0df64e-cf41-11e4-af1c-1b8df43f199d.html "Oregon man accused of selling fentanyl that led to ND death"), [6](http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/local/3648953-police-investigate-suspected-drug-overdose-death-grand-forks "Police investigate suspected drug overdose death in Grand Forks"), [7](http://koin.com/2015/03/11/fentanyl-bitcoin-and-the-seedy-side-of-the-web/ "Fentanyl, Bitcoin and the seedy side of the web: Three people from Portland and Southwest Washington are accused in the plot"), [8](http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/crime-and-courts/3704033-oregon-man-indicted-fatal-grand-forks-overdose-case "Oregon man indicted in fatal Grand Forks overdose case").)
In Grand Forks North Dakota, Ryan Jensen sold fentanyl to Henke. Henke died on 3 January 2015, triggering a search of the house the same day, revealing his friend, Jensen, had bought it from a domestic Evolution seller, Brandon Hubbard. (Hubbard's seller account is not identified in the media or few available court documents, but he may have been the seller "pdxblack", given the PDX acronym and accusation that a buyer "Montey6456" was falsely claiming to have been arrested.) Jensen and the other two people who smoked fentanyl with Henke were all 3 charged ([Jensen plea agreement](/docs/sr/jensen-ndd-1370889738.pdf)).
They then did undercover buys from Hubbard, busting him in Portland Oregon after searches 22 January 2015 ([Hubbard complaint](/docs/sr/hubbard-ord-15105281613.pdf)).
He cooperated, [pled guilty](http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/3981314-oregon-man-pleads-guilty-integral-role-grand-forks-fentanyl-deaths "Oregon man pleads guilty for 'integral role' in Grand Forks fentanyl deaths"), and Hubbard turned out to source his fentanyl from China through a Canadian contact, using Steven Locke as a drop who was paid in fentanyl (he was indicated 10 March 2015).
Hubbard's girlfriend, Channing Lacey, was later arrested 5 March 2015 but had smuggled in some fentanyl, leading to another 3 overdoses.
Collectively, 5+ ODs or deaths were involved.

On 11 May 2016, a federal court case was filed in Florida charging Fadhle Muqbel Saeed under the pseudonyms "darkexpresso"/"bonappetit"/"Damien Darko", along with Julian Villa-Gomez Lemus & Alfonso Bojorquez-Vazquez, for sale of marijuana, methamphetamine, and hydrocodone from 2012 to 2015.
No further details were given in the [indictment](/docs/sr/darkexpress-indictment-flmd-047016068221.pdf) or [docket](/docs/sr/2016-05-24-pacer-darkexpresso.mht) as of 24 May 2016.
Lemus was [found guilty in January 2017](https://www.justice.gov/usao-mdfl/pr/california-man-convicted-conspiracy-distribute-drugs-internet "California Man Convicted Of Conspiracy To Distribute Drugs On The Internet") & the other two pled guilty shortly before.
["darkexpresso"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/1dc066e61a.htm) was a SR1 vendor who sold marijuana; "bonappetit" was a seller on Evolution up until he disappeared sometime around the end date cited in the indictment.

## Hydra
### Hungary

The operator of the minor marketplace Hydra [was detained or arrested](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/11/watch-alleged-hydra-market-admin-getting-busted-in-budapest/) in Budapest, Hungary as part of Operation Onymous; the date is unclear but probably before 7 November 2014 & simultaneous with the other arrests on 5 November 2014.

## Nucleus
### India

[On 16 December 2015](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Hyderabad-2-drug-peddlers-held/articleshow/50212016.cms "Hyderabad: 2 drug peddlers held"), 2 Hyderabad brothers (20/22yo) Mayank Kumar Sahu & Piyush Kumar Sahu were arrested for purchasing LSD off Nucleus; the LSD had been given to 3 other Indian men for local resale, who had been busted and informed on the Sahus.

## Sheep Marketplace (SMP)
### Czech

In March 2015, news broke that the Czech man Tomáš Jiřikovský <!-- Tomas Jirikovsky --> was the target of [a criminal complaint for money laundering](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/30k8d8/a_little_official_info_about_sheep_case_from/ "A little official info about Sheep case from Czech Ministry of Finance") related to [large sales of bitcoins for Czech crowns deposited into his wife's account, reported by her bank, which were then used to purchase a house](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/30h8r9/sheepmarketplace_owner_busted_by_czech_police/cpsgt2o) (the house was seized).
Jiřikovský had been [identified in November 2013 by an anonymous American](/docs/sr/2013-11-03-sheepmarketplace-doxxing.maff), based on circumstantial evidence, as the operator of Sheep Marketplace, not long before Sheep shut down in an apparent exit scam; it's unknown whether that doxing has any connection to the money-laundering accusation or if that was triggered purely by the money transfers, or when exactly the complaint was filed & house seized (the news broke publicly in March 2015 but the finance ministry 2014 report mentioning the case is dated 22 February 2015 and the investigation may've begun January 2014).
He was then arrested [sometime before 30 April 2016](http://brnensky.denik.cz/zlociny-a-soudy/ukradl-109-milionu-ve-virtualni-mene-20160430.html "Ukradl 109 milionů. Ve virtuální měně") on both money laundering & drug charges; as of [16 August 2016](http://brno.idnes.cz/bitcoiny-jihomoravska-policie-rozhovor-fd6-/brno-zpravy.aspx?c=A160816_2266665_brno-zpravy_krut "Bitcoinový mág vydělal miliony, díky jihomoravským policistům sedí v cele") he was (but not his wife) was still in prison; [as of April 2017](https://news.bitcoin.com/darknet-market-operators-who-stole-40-thousand-btc-face-prison-time/) he & his wife were apparently on trial & likely to be sentenced soon:

> According to regional reports, Jiřikovský and his wife Eve who was allegedly Sheep's programmer have been going through the motions of trial and will likely be sentenced in the near future. "He faces 10 to 18 years in prison," said Hynek Olma, a spokesman for the regional prosecutor's office. "We filed the indictment for crimes of unauthorized production and the handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances, theft and illegal possession of firearms. The woman was charged with the crime of legalization of proceeds from crime", explained Olma. Olma added that Eve was facing three to eight years in prison for being an accomplice. The U.S. had also arrested two individuals connected with Jiřikovský and his wife back in May of 2016. Nathan Gibson and Sean Mackert tried to convert the funds via Coinbase and were caught by government agencies in the state of Florida. Coinbase at the time received a subpoena and revealed Gibson had deposited over 842 bitcoins with the company.

### Sweden

In 2014, [media](https://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2014/11/07/111500.htm "FBI-aktion lukker danske narkohandlere på nettet: FBI og Europol lukker flere narkosites i kæmpe fælles operation. Også danske narkosælgere er blevet lukket ned.") [articles](http://web.archive.org/web/20140614152830/http://www.kristianstadsbladet.se/kristianstad/article2176043/Knarkhandel-kan-ge-flera-ar-i-fangelse.html "Knarkhandel kan ge flera år i fängelse") revealed that 2 Swedish men had been arrested in the Malmö region but did not give details.
[Another article](http://www.expressen.se/kvallsposten/salde-narkotika---tva-unga-man-far-fangelse/ "Sålde narkotika - två unga män får fängelse") reports that they had been arrested 27 November 2013, they had been selling "cannabis, amphetamines, MDMA, cocaine and pills" in considerable volume (at least 1500 sales, starting on Silk Road 1), and the police had conducted several undercover buys from them on Sheep Marketplace, leading to their de-anonymization and then phone & physical surveillance.
Nowhere is it mentioned which seller this is; ["ChrisHash"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/8e0f635ee5.htm) initially seemed a likely candidate but [he seems to have still been active as of September 2014](https://www.flashback.org/sp50195930) and so can be rejected, and there is no available information about Flugsvamp's "christianiaexpressen".
Searching my Sheep mirror from ~1 December 2013 (~4 days after the two men's arrest), I found there seemed to be only a few sellers who shipped out of Sweden: ["Livefromsweden"/"LFS"](/docs/sr/sheep-20121203-profile-livefromsweden-05abde47fcf35cd033ff12b9254bf3a0.html), "KurtsDroghandel", "Freedom Express", "Sweetkush", and "swelease".
I ignore Freedom Express (sold only Xanax), Sweetkush (only amphetamine), KurtsDroghandel (only weed, hashish, & LSD), leaving LFS & swelease.
swelease did sell amphetamine, MDMA, and Ritalin (which could be "pills"), but my mirror says he was last logged in "10 hours ago", which is not very consistent with having been arrested;
in contrast, LFS is almost a perfect match as they sold a great deal of amphetamine, cocaine, weed, and two pill listings ("tilnoct, Swedish pharmacy, 10mg", "Tramadol, 100mg, Hexal"), so they match except for not selling MDMA, and they boast that "on SR i was topp [sic] 10% domestic seller in Sweden with many transactions made."; and finally, they were last logged in "4 days ago", or around when the two men were arrested.
Hence, I identify these two men as being the SR1/Sheep seller Livefromsweden.
Complicating the narrative, the LFS bust may have only been half the story; a [Swedish police article](https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/Gemensam/2014/okt/Sa-stoppade-Skanepolisen-internetlangarna/) describes the bust of a seller in Helsingborg (he was sentenced to 8 years), then 2 young men who are clearly LFS from the timing & location & age & sentences, then a fourth arrest in Malmo (he was sentenced to 7 years).
While the Helsingborg and Malmo men sound like they were part of LFS, I am a little doubtful because none of the initial LFS media coverage mentioned 2 others being charged.

## Silk Road 1 (SR1)
### Australia

The [prosecution](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2012/july/afp-and-Customs-warn-users-of-silk-road.aspx "Media Release: AFP and Customs warn users of Silk Road") & [conviction](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/secret-website-harboured-drugs-smorgasbord-court-hears-20130131-2dlw3.html) of the SR seller Paul Leslie Howard ("Shadh1") was to related to a Customs interception of his large imports from Netherlands/Germany according to the [judge's sentencing verdict](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCC/2013/70.html) and then a July 2012 search.

Another Australian seller (unknown which one, possibly "DownUnderDan" or "DopeBoyAus"), Christopher Owen, was pulled over by police on 27 April 2012 while driving to the post office to mail shipments, the drugs found, his house searched, and [was sentenced to 5 years](http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/1508217/jail-time-for-web-drug-trafficker/ "Jail time for web drug trafficker") ([discussion](/docs/sr/2013-04-17-australia.mht "Title: SILK ROAD VENDOR JUST GOT BUSTED AND CONVICTED Post by: AussieMitch on May 17, 2013, 12:59 am")).

Sometime in August 2012, the MDMA buyer Ryan West, who resold locally, was raided and eventually [convicted of 4 charges](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-05/dark-internet-linked-to-drug-seizure-spike/4410872 "Dealers shed light on dark Internet's drug trade").

[2 unnamed teens](http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/breaking/14980079/brothers-in-court-over-online-drugs/ "Brothers in court over online drugs") made the mistake of ordering marijuana, MDMA, and amphetamines from SR1; their parents turned them in & they were charged in September 2012.

A [7 November 2012](http://www.theherald.com.au/story/734298/detectives-follow-the-silk-road/ "Detectives follow the Silk Road") Australian article claims 30 interceptions a month in an area, but mentions nothing specific about arrests.
A [December 2012 article](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-12-05/dark-internet-linked-to-drug-seizure-spike/4410872 "Dealers shed light on dark Internet's drug trade") quotes Customs claiming a 40% increase in seizures, but then quotes a SR seller as claiming a doubling or quadrupling of Australian buyers (hence, implying the interception rate has halved or worse).
Estimating total number of Australian users is difficult, but the 2012 Global Drug Survey reportedly found [184 SR purchasers in its sample of >6600 Australians](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/teens-flock-to-hidden-website-for-drugs-20130319-2gddg.html "Teens flock to hidden website for drugs") suggesting a risk of arrest or publicity $\lt \frac{5}{184}$ (and incidentally, remembering this is a biased sample and the South Australian [recent illicit drug use rate](http://www.dassa.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=204 "Statistics on Illicit Drug Use in South Australia") is ~14.9%, it suggests a very loose upper bound of all Australian SR users of $23000000 \times 0.149 \times \frac{184}{6600} \lt 95541$).

The teen Preston Bridge died accidentally after falling on [16 February 2013](https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/17887955/drug-warning-for-teens/ "Synthetic LSD and an online 'eBay for drugs' known as the Silk Road have been linked to the death of popular Churchlands student Preston Bridge.") after taking "synthetic LSD" ([probably NBOMe](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-07/deadly-chemical-nbom-e-blamed-for-teenagers-drug-deaths/4872078 "Research chemical NBOMe linked to drug deaths of teenagers Henry Kwan, Nick Mitchell, Preston Bridge")) bought by a friend on Silk Road; the friend was [prosecuted & sentenced to 12 months' probation](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-06-09/teenager-sentenced-for-offering-drugs-to-a-boy-who-died-balcony/5510468 "Hotel balcony death: Teenager sentenced for offering to supply drugs bought on Silk Road to Preston Bridge") on [9 June 2014](https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/24196801/teen-spared-jail-over-preston-lsd-offer/ "Teen spared jail over Preston LSD offer").

On [19 February 2013](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2015/35.html "Supreme Court of Victoria - Court of Appeal: Ludwig v The Queen [2015] VSCA 35 (10 March 2015)"), Samuel Ryan Ludwig was arrested & bailed after a search of his home prompted by a package intercepted by Customs on 15 February 2013.
(The search turned up MDMA, LSD, ketamine, methylamphetamine, and amphetamine.)
That was one of ~7 packages intercepted October 2012 - February 2013; 5 more, containing drugs, laser pointers, and safrole oil would be intercepted February-March 2013, and additional MDMA & laser pointer packages would be intercepted, triggering another search of Ludwig's residence while he was out on bail and a second arrest 22 August 2013.

Also on [19 February 2013](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VCC/2014/1982.html "DPP v Franzini [2014] VCC 1982 (26 November 2014)"), [Patrick Franzini](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/drug-accused-allowed-to-travel-to-world-cup-20140605-39l02.html "Drug accused allowed to travel to World Cup") [was arrested](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/drug-dealer-who-was-granted-bail-to-attend-soccer-world-cup-escapes-jail-term-20141126-11uei8.html "Drug dealer who was granted bail to attend soccer World Cup escapes jail term") after a search related to 3 customs interceptions November 2012 - February 2013 of methamphetamine & MDMA sent from Netherlands, Canada, & China.
The search turned up pseudoephedrine, DMT, and ketamine; Franzini cooperated, providing additional information like his SR1 account (he had made a total of 19 orders).

On 20 June 2013, [an Australian man was arrested after a CD of safrole oil](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2013/july/media%20release-joint-operation-results-in-significant-offshore-disruption.aspx "Media Release: Joint operation results in significant offshore disruption") (a MDMA precursor) imported from Indonesia; this was part of an investigation triggered by Customs intercepting 4 Indonesian packages of safrole oil.
The Indonesian seller was later arrested in Indonesia.

On [21 February 2013](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinodisp/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2014/291.html), Lee James Matthews's home was searched and he was arrested.
~2 of 21 packages had been intercepted, and the search turned up MDMA, cocaine, methamphetamine, & amphetamines from his 93 orders, most of which he resold locally.

[Reportedly (1 July 2013)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130810215355/http://au.news.yahoo.com/today-tonight/lifestyle/article/-/17821047/online-black-market "Online drug market: Drug smugglers have taken their business online, using a hidden website to sell illicit substances and delivering them straight to people's doors."), a June 2013 Parcel Post sting seized 140 packages/\$8m & "Six of those arrested were Silk Road members."
These 6 arrests are currently unknown aside from 1 likely being a safrole oil buyer. (Possibly 5, if one assumes that Adam Bunger's BMR Australian customer is included in that count and the quote is slightly inaccurate.)

As of July 2013, there was ["at least one criminal prosecution in WA [Western Australia] that involves Silk Road"](http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/wa/17891240/silk-road-deals-go-underground/ "Silk Road deals go underground"), and WA police estimate "47 active Australian-based sellers who use Silk Road"; that prosecution may have been "A 26-year-old man, who was charged with attempting to possess drugs from the site, was fined \$1000" [as of 10 August 2013](https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/18437383/first-wa-convictions-for-silk-road-trades/ "First WA convictions for Silk Road trades").

An Australian investigation starting in January 2013 [arrested two fake ID manufacturers](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/hundreds-of-fake-credit-cards-and-identities-seized-from-a-western-sydney-home-set-up-as-a-factory-of-fraud/story-fni0cx12-1226717700640 "Hundreds of fake credit cards and identities seized from a western Sydney home set up as a factory of fraud") on 10 September 2013; coverage does not mention SR, but [a Redditor plausibly identifies them](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o8xsb/australian_id_vendor_ausid_busted_not_due_to_sr/) as having been the fake ID seller "Ausid" who stopped selling on SR in March 2013.

At some point in mid-2013 ("just months before it [SR1] was closed down"), the Australian man Luke Hanley was [arrested after 2 packages of 25i & 25c](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/man-faces-jail-after-2700-drug-tablets-on-notorious-site-silk-road/story-fni0fee2-1226851736371 "Man faces jail after 2700 drug tablets on notorious site Silk Road") (and possibly an amphetamine package) were intercepted by Customs, and [pled guilty in 2014](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-14/melbourne-man-avoids-jail-for-ordering-drugs-on-silk-road-websi/5321098 "Victorian man avoids jail for ordering drugs on Silk Road website").

In August 2013, a 18yo South Bunbury, West Australian male Jackson R. was [charged with heroin (actually DMT)](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-23/police-turn-attention-to-online-drug-trade/4908264 "Police focus turns to online drug trade") [& 2C-e possession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7YCVuqaL2E "Silk Road delivery lands 18 year old in trouble 'Jackson R'"); in an [account on FB then reposted on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/3egrvv/silk_road_1_bust_not_documented_by_gwern/), he explains that he had ordered the DMT off SR1 from a Czech seller (the media coverage claiming it was heroin being wrong) and his parents turned the package in to the police after it arrived, with the subsequent police search turning up his 2C-E as well.

The former Silk Road moderator/employee SSBD/Symmetry was [arrested in Brisbane on 20 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf)).

In [Barratt et al 2016](https://www.academia.edu/24382120 "'What if you live on top of a bakery and you like cakes?'-Drug use and harm trajectories before, during and after the emergence of Silk Road"), reporting about a series of anonymous interviews conducted over TorChat 2011-2014 with SR1 users, they mention one Australian user claimed to have been arrested:

> ...Tapering down drug use after a honeymoon period was not only triggered by the practice of 'portion control' and/or satiated desires, but also by other life events. For example, P1 (21-25 yrs, USA) explained "After last semester I'm more interested in grades than highs" and P4 (21-25 yrs, Australia) described how "I'd rather buy a flight than a gram of coke". In the case of P25 (21-25 yrs, Australia), who was buying large amounts from Silk Road and dealing from his home, a police raid resulted in supply charges, which led to a tapering of drug use and cryptomarket activity.

The age bracket and when they concluded interviewing suggests that this SR1 user was arrested before 2014, and there are only around two known arrests in that age bracket and period for SR1; combined with background knowledge that only a small fraction of buyer arrests are ever reported (see [discussion of completeness of the arrest table](#completeness)), it is highly likely that this arrest is not otherwise in the table.

A [Launceston, Tasmania man was sentenced to prison during 23-29 March 2014](http://www.examiner.com.au/story/2185778/hidden-drug-site-use-increasing/) due to possession of 25i & BDMPEA partially (?) bought on SR; it's unclear how or when he was caught.

The Victorian authorities report [confiscating "several million dollars" (฿24,518) in Bitcoin](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-state-election-2014/bitcoin-drug-millions-seized-in-victoria-20141015-116bby.html "Bitcoin drug millions seized in Victoria") [in 2013 after a December 2012 search](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/australian-authorities-sitting-on-96-million-worth-of-bitcoins-confiscated-from-silk-road-drug-dealer-20141031-11ewk4.html) & arrest of Richard Pollard, who resold MDMA/cocaine/ketamine/fentanyl/etc (eventually sentenced to [6-7 years](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/silk-road-drug-trafficker-has-jail-term-reduced-on-appeal-20150609-ghjskt.html "Silk Road drug trafficker has jail term reduced on appeal")); through online accounts, it seems likely he was ["1StopOz"](http://antilop.cc/sr/users/1stopoz/) who was noted as disappearing before January 2013 and given a journalist's comment that "The court heard Pollard ran a 'one-stop shop'".
(The coins [were planned to be auctioned off](http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/victorian-government-to-sell-93-million-in-seized-bitcoins-20150316-1lzyg2.html "Victorian government to sell $9.3 million in seized bitcoins") by [June 2016](http://www.afr.com/technology/ernst--young-16-million-bitcoin-auction-20160527-gp53i0 "Ernst & Young to sell $16 million in confiscated Bitcoin at auction in Sydney").)

(The ["Meanwhile in Australia..." SR1F thread](http://www.webcacher.org/silkroad1-forums-anonymous/2013-10-15/Market/Rumor%20mill/2012.10.21_0556am%20==%20Meanwhile%20in%20Australia...%20==%20thread_56466%20==%20by%20MeanwhileinAustralia.html) confirms he shipped internationally as well.)

### Austria

On 4 November 2013, 2 men were arrested (media: [1](http://www.wien-heute.at/p-73978.php "St. Pölten: Suchtmittelhandel via Internet aufgeflogen und zerschlagen: Das Landeskriminalamt NÖ - Ermittlungsbereich Suchtmittelkriminalität - führte umfangreiche Erhebungen in Zusammenarbeit mit Beamtinnen und Beamten des Bundeskriminalamtes, Einsatzgruppe zur Bekämpfung der Suchtmittelkriminalität, und des FBIs im Bereich 'Handel mit Suchtmittel via Internet' durch"); [2](http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/1551538/St-Poltener-zogen-Drogenhandel-via-Internet-auf "St. Pöltener zogen Drogenhandel via Internet auf: In Zusammenarbeit mit dem FBI hat die niederösterreichische Polizei zwei Männer ausgeforscht, die Drogen über eine Internetplattform vertrieben haben sollen"); [3](http://noe.orf.at/news/stories/2626608/ "Silk-Road: Festnahme in St. Pölten")) for selling opium, MDMA, & amphetamine, as well as, apparently, 6 of their customers - others may have been arrested outside Austria but no mention of those.
Based on [a forum thread](/docs/sr/sr2f-18619-austriaarrest-blackjack021.html) & seller profile, [I've identified this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/2xlxhs/sr1_seller_blackjack021_6_customers_busted_in/) as the SR1 seller "Blackjack021".

### Canada

The aforementioned Tessellated claimed "we have not even once had a report of anyone having any legal trouble or 'love letters' from our product. On several occasions customs has opened our package, not found the product and sent it intact to the buyer."

In May 2012, the high-volume cocaine Canadian seller "moveitnice"/"MiN" mentioned postal delays and then disappeared; according to buyers in [the forum discussion](/docs/sr/2013-11-11-moveitnicebust.mht "http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?action=printpage;topic=23378.0 Title: I'm calling my shot. MiN has gone rogue/been compromised. Post by: Iamnotamod on May 16, 2012, 07:00 pm"), moveitnice accepted Western Union and the recipient of the WU payments matched the names in [the arrests of a family of 4 Ottawans](https://web.archive.org/web/20150211203002/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ottawa/ne-no/pr-cp/2012/20120518-eng.htm "Family of 4 charged with exporting cocaine overseas") for mailing cocaine which was announced by the RCMP on 18 May. (My search of Canadian court records was unable to find their case; possibly their case has been publication-banned or discharged.)
[_Gawker_](http://gawker.com/5926440/are-authorities-closing-in-on-the-online-drug-market-silk-road "Are Authorities Closing In On the Online Drug Market Silk Road?") mentions rumors they may have been busted because they accepted payment via [Western Union](!Wikipedia).

On 2 August 2012, [British Columbia resident James Fowler was raided](http://www.campbellrivermirror.com/news/257558681.html "Online drug dealer delivered by mail") after an investigation started in May 2012 based on an anonymous tip that he was selling drugs online and subsequent "electronic surveillance".
The raid turned up marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, guns, and computer evidence of his online sales through "different websites, including his own".
[La Moustache has identified](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/39ck7u/sr1_2012_bust_seller_warweedjames_fowler/-) Fowler as the SR1 seller "warweed" due to a BitcoinTalk.org account with a shared email address and other details (such as warweed's announcement of being arrested in August 2012).

Also in August 2012, neighbors tipped off Calgary, Alberta police about drug sales in a house; the raid also [turned up a garage](https://web.archive.org/web/20120827025357/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Homes+evacuated+police+bust+suspected+drug/7136987/story.html) for producing DMT, and [Shawn Casey was arrested & charged](http://www.calgarysun.com/2012/08/25/dmt-suspected-in-drug-lab "DMT suspected in drug bust") 22 August 2012.
He has been identified on Reddit ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/ysm4d/canadian_dmt_vendor_trojan_potentially_busted_in/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/26zwdx/maybe_this_is_to_much_to_ask/chw4d06)) & [SR1F](/docs/sr/2013-04-16-dmt.mht "Title: Curious about SR Vendor busts Post by: mollyexpress on April 16, 2013, 06:06 am") as the Calgary DMT seller "Trojan".

### France

On 21 December 2013, the French seller "WalkaBoot" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/ce349694a5.htm)) of marijuana & amphetamines and his female accomplice [were arrested by Customs](http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/info-bfmtv-loire-un-cyberdealer-interpelle-premiere-france-674582.html "INFO BFMTV - Loire: un cyberdealer interpellé, première en France: Depuis une ferme isolée, il vendait des produits stupéfiants sur Internet en utilisant un routeur indétectable. Un mode opératoire inédit en France. Interpellé samedi dernier, il a été présenté mardi devant la justice") ([additional details in video](/docs/sr/lamoustache-walkaboot-video.zip)) after undercover buys.

### Germany

4 people were [arrested in Germany](/docs/sr/2013-07-09-germany.mht "Title: Big Germany bust. Arrest of Silk Road vendor a big maybe. Post by: DealerOfDrugs on July 09, 2013, 02:40 pm") 4 July 2013, apparently by tracing another drug seller's supplier with repeated orders which were sent from the same spot by the couriers (and were easily busted), and then to that SR seller-group "AfterHour" & possibly payments via mail (German coverage: [1](http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/ermittler-zerschlagen-internationalen-drogenring-a-910221.html "Internationaler Drogenring: Ermittler nehmen vier Verdächtige fest"), [2](http://www.welt.de/regionales/muenchen/article117869257/Fahnder-zerschlagen-Bitcoin-Drogenring-DarkNet.html "Fahnder zerschlagen Bitcoin-Drogenring DarkNet: Über eine verschlüsselte Plattform im Internet hat eine Bande mit Drogen gehandelt. 'Hochprofessionell und nahezu perfekt', wie ein Ermittler sagt. Den Fahndern gingen die Täter trotzdem ins Netz."), [3](http://www.kleinezeitung.at/nachrichten/chronik/3352090/globaler-drogenring-zerschlagen.story "Globaler Drogenring zerschlagen: In einer konzertierten Aktion haben Fahnder in Deutschland einen internationalen Drogenhändler-Ring zerschlagen.

The leader [cooperated](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2017/04/07/afterhour-mildly-sentenced-working-police/) and was sentenced to 4.83 years, with lesser sentences for the others.

Simultaneous with the AfterHour bust, the SR1 seller "Pfandleiher"/Sascha F. [was also](http://www.zeit.de/2014/12/drogenhandel-silk-road-pfandleiher "Kokain vom 'Pfandleiher': Ein 24-Jähriger aus der bayerischen Provinz könnte mit Drogengeschäften über das Internet Millionen erwirtschaftet haben. Nun steht er vor Gericht.") [arrested](http://www.zeit.de/2014/12/drogenhandel-silk-road-pfandleiher/seite-2 "pg2") by German police.
The original investigation triggered by another seller's wrongly-addressed package and then a general postal investigation led to AfterHour and Pfandleiher.

<!-- TODO: SR1F claims other German sellers 'imprint'? -->

[On 11 January 2016](http://www.nordbayern.de/region/nuernberg/drogenshopping-im-darknet-vier-jahre-haft-fur-bruderpaar-1.4909103 "Drogenshopping im Darknet: Vier Jahre Haft für Brüderpaar"), 2 brothers (30/32yo) from Fürth were sentenced to 4 years prison stemming from an arrest in "early 2015" related to an inspection of a package; they had apparently been buying on SR1 and AfterHour 2012-2014, making ~40 orders of marijuana/amphetamines/MDMA/cocaine for their consumption & local resale.

[In early October 2015, a former SR1 marijuana buyer was](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/4l7m4t/sr1_seller_natural_weed_arrested_german_buyer/ "SR1 seller 'Natural Weed' arrested; German buyer prosecuted over seller records + server image"), despite no package interceptions & always using PGP, [prosecuted & fined](/docs/sr/2016-naturalweed-buyerfine.pdf) for his 2013 SR1 purchases (and, oddly, 1 Outlaw Market order) from, among other sellers, the SR1 seller "Natural Weed", a man named "Tobias Wald", who apparently had been arrested at some point prior and turned over seller records which were then linked to order information on the SR1 server image provided by the FBI.

### Indonesia

On 23 July 2013, an Indonesian man (likely the seller ["joy"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/632318af0c.htm)) [was arrested in Jakarta for selling safrole oil](http://www.afp.gov.au/media-centre/news/afp/2013/july/media%20release-joint-operation-results-in-significant-offshore-disruption.aspx "Media Release: Joint operation results in significant offshore disruption") (one of his Australian buyers had already been CDed and at least 4 shipments intercepted before then).

### Ireland

On 5 August 2013, 3 men (Ryan Thomas McManus, Ryan Milligan, Connor Devenney) who were the seller ["sonicdrone"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/f028f01ceb.htm), [were arrested](http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/northern-ireland-men-jailed-over-9147435 "Northern Ireland men jailed over running international drugs 'party pack' business; Pair used darknet facility called Silk Road to buy and sell drugs across globe") [in Ireland](http://www.u.tv/News/2015/04/29/Men-jailed-over-dark-web-drugs-offences-36382 "Men jailed over 'dark web' drugs offences: Two men who were involved in an international drugs operation which included purchasing illegal substances on the 'dark web' using Bitcoin currency have been jailed."), and they were sentenced in April 2015; they had been selling a variety of drugs but principally cocaine, mephedrone, MDMA, marijuana, 2C-b, & LSD.
How they were caught is unclear, but surveillance of a "virtual mailbox facility" they used to receive packages seem to have played a crucial role, possibly sparked by a failed attempt to mail 60g of marijuana to a Canadian customer.
(Media coverage mentions another pseudonym, "blackwater86", which is the name a mostly-unused SR1F account and not another seller as far as I can tell; possibly it was used in ordering from their American & Chinese supplier.)

On [20 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf)), the former SR administrator/moderator/employee "Libertas" (also of Silk Road 2) was [arrested in Wicklow, Ireland](http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2013/1220/494111-silk-road-arrest/ "Former Silk Road administrator arrested in Wicklow") but apparently [made bail](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/12/20/feds-indict-three-more-alleged-employees-of-the-silk-roads-dread-pirate-roberts/ "Feds Indict Three More Alleged Employees Of Silk Road's Dread Pirate Roberts") and continues to fight extradition with hearings initially scheduled for [late July 2015](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/high-court/extradition-case-of-man-linked-to-silk-road-to-be-heard-in-july-1.2191952 "Extradition case of man linked to 'Silk Road' to be heard in July; Gary Davis, from Kilpedder, Co Wicklow, wanted by US authorities over 'black market' website").

### Israel

DeepDotWeb reports (personal communication) that at the beginning of 2013, a small Israeli buyer of multiple drugs off SR1 (unknown seller) was arrested & sentenced to six months.

### Italy

On 10 August 2015, DDW published ["The  Story of an Italian Unlucky Cyber Pusher"](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/08/10/the-%E2%80%8Astory-of-an-italian-unlucky-cyber-pusher/), which claims to be the memoir of a small Italian [SR1/BMR seller "Fuckthepolice137"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/045a2d1d9b.htm) who sold internationally 2012-2013 primarily marijuana & MDMA along with some sildenafil.
He was arrested at the end of June 2013; Italian customs had intercepted packages to another bigger Italian drug trafficker, who was then arrested, and their emails with him were found, leading to his own raid & arrest.

### Japan

Ayumu Teramoto was [arrested for importing 50g of a "stimulant"](http://www.nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/Japan-makes-Bitcoin-linked-drug-arrest-police-medi-30233259.html) in May 2014.

### Netherlands

In April 2013, [6 Dutchmen](http://www.mickvanwely.nl/de-xtc-bende-van-sinterklaas/) were arrested for MDMA sales on SR; the arrests stemmed from a car search turning up thousands of pills in 22 November 2012 and then a raid of their manufacturing location 5 April 2013 (one commenter [speculates](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1lkm8i/dutch_vendors_selling_xtc_packaged_in_church_dvds/cc0ef4v) they were the missing MDMA seller "MedicalM").

On 9 October 2013, following a month of wiretapping & Blackberry observation, 2 Dutchmen (the seller "XTCExpress") were [arrested while making MDMA pills & charged](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o8sek/vendor_xtcexpress_arrested_in_the_netherlands_on/) ([_Daily Mail_](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2456758/Two-Dutch-Silk-Road-vendors-alias-XTC-Express-caught-red-handed-layer-MDMA-hair.html)), ultimately [receiving 4-5 years](http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2014/05/08/rechter-geeft-online-drugsdealers-tot-vijf-jaar-cel/ "Judge gives online drug dealers five years in prison").

The MDMA seller "SuperTrips" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/24bb54ca7e.htm); [DoJ announcement](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01.html); [complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2013_08_28_SLOMP_affidavit.pdf); [charges](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/silkroadplea.pdf)) was arrested on traveling to the USA in August 2013 to meet a SR1 reseller, "UnderGroundSyndicate"/"BTCMaster" (who was arrested with SuperTrip's help in October).
US Customs intercepted >100 packages mailed by SuperTrips, built up a profile, found fingerprints on the packages, checked the Netherlands's fingerprint databases & found a match, detained SuperTrips when he attempted to enter the USA, seized & searched his laptop's files (illustrating the lack of civil rights at borders), he admitted selling during an interview, and eventually reached a plea agreement.
His arrest was rumored on forums, and DPR2 of SR2 [specifically alluded to SuperTrip's arrest](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/02/dread-pirate-roberts-2-0-an-interview-with-silk-roads-new-boss/) in late 2013/early 2014 that "it was quite boring the third time law enforcement decided to use the 'SuperTrips' moniker and claiming to be him as a free man, when I know just as well as ICE where he is now", although the case was only publicly announced in April 2014.

### New Zealand (NZ)

An unnamed Australian student's MDMA from SR1 (bought for local resale) was [intercepted by Customs](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10819029 "Officer's link to net drug market") sometime in 2012 and he was, at a minimum, interviewed, but the 11 July 2012 article makes no mention of additional penalties.
A New Zealand Customs officer who highly likely used SR1 (although he denies ordering, saying he had been researching it for his job) was charged with possessing & "supplying" methamphetamine but this "was uncovered during police inquiries into another crime", with the resolution unclear.

Isaac Patiari Teaukura Maki's MDMA from the Netherlands was confiscated by Customs on 28 June 2012 and his house visited, whereupon he admitted guilt to the officers and unsurprisingly was [arrested](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/7954851/Drug-importer-jailed "Drug importer jailed") & [convicted](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/court/7958999/Drugs-ordered-on-web "Drugs ordered on web").

A [NZ article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10826287 "Online drug trade triggers high alert") claimed 80 interceptions a month with 7 arrests January-July 2012 or 1 arrest a month (suggesting each interception has a risk of leading to an arrest of ~1/80; the risk per order then depends on how many of the 52m items were drug packages), specifically:
'"There have been approximately 80 intercepts a month [from] people we believe have utilised the Silk Road enterprise," Day said. In cases linked to Silk Road from January to July, 13 search warrants were issued, 15 further properties visited and 7 arrests made.'
Since both the Customs officer & Maki were arrested in that January-July 2012 period (Simon Lim falls outside it), that leaves 5 arrests unaccounted for.

What seems to be a third NZer, Simon Lim, was arrested sometime in 2012, pled guilty in October 2012 & was [sentenced to 18 months probation](http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/chch-man-sentenced-after-buying-amazon-illegal-drugs-website-ck-135659 "Christchurch man sentenced after buying from 'Amazon of illegal drugs' website") in 7 February 2013 for buying cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD and others off Silk Road.

On [23 April 2013](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/8604002/Student-accused-of-drug-importing-freed-on-bail "Student accused of drug importing freed on bail"), a student Benjamen Patrick Belmont importing cocaine, MDMA, & LSD from Netherlands & UK for resale had packages intercepted by Customs, leading to a search, guilty pleas, and then [sentencing in February 2014](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9896985/Jail-for-drug-importing-student).
(That article also estimates 52m items passing through Customs in 2012 with 1.4k intercepted as drugs.)

[Two NZers were searched 1 August 2013](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/64084873/Jail-for-selling-drugs-and-making-pipe-bomb) (Matthew Benjamin Collins & Jared Arthur Underwood), turning up a variety of drugs they had imported from the UK & Netherlands after September 2012 from "encrypted internet sites" (given the timing, SR1), apparently for local resale given the pill presses mentioned.

In September 2013, [3 NZers](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/court/9133368/Trio-got-drugs-from-internet-site "Trio got drugs from internet site") (Michael David John Kitto, Andrew James Furness, Gareth John Edlin) were convicted of importing MDMA & cocaine from Germany & the Netherlands, after [a search warrant on 3 July 2013](http://www.stuff.co.nz/southland-times/news/court/9025924/Curiosity-leads-to-drug-conviction "Curiosity leads to drug conviction")

Another NZer,  Dylan Terry Richardson, was [sentenced December 2013 for](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9517934/Silk-Road-to-jail-for-meth-importer "Silk Road to jail for meth importer") [importing methamphetamine](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9156769/Drug-import-accused-in-court "Drug import accused in court") in August 2013 (intercepted by Customs) leading to an arrest on [3 September 2013](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/9125536/City-drug-bust "City drug bust")

And a fourth NZer's (Andrew Trevor Harrison) 2 MDMA & NBOMe shipments from Netherlands & Canada were intercepted in September 2013 by Customs, leading to a search of his house & [sentencing in April 2014](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/9945908/Psychedelic-tabs-ordered-online "Psychedelic tabs ordered online").

On 11 December 2013, another 3 NZers were arrested over various orders of "small quantities of LSD, Methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), Class C analogue powders and the psychoactive substance NBOMe" from unspecified DNMs "such as 'The Silk Road'". (Inasmuch as Silk Road was busted 2 October 2013, they may have actually been ordering from a replacement such as Sheep MarketPlace.)

In April 2014, the [NZ man  Peter James Grossett was convicted](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10232509/Doing-time-for-drugs-bought-online) after 2 packages of methamphetamine from Canada were intercepted in September & November 2013; the search had also turned up LSD and marijuana.
(The article mentions he bought from another market after SR1 shut down, but not which one - it could have been Sheep or TorMarket or BMR given the broad time range.)

In December 2014, the SR1 MDMA/marijuana buyers Daniel Wayne Fowler & Lisa Marie Clark were sentenced after an investigating beginning with customs intercepts of German/Belgium packages in September 2013 ([1](http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/63779228/Silk-Road-drug-buyers-in-court "Silk Road drug buyers in court") [2](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11368206 "Man imported drugs like 'ordering pizza'")).

A [2015 _NZ Herald_ article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11432096 "Drug mail or mule: risks the same; Customs warns users who buy online after increase in intercepted packages") reports some aggregate information from Customs:

> Cocaine catches increased from five in 2011/12 to 54 in 2013/14, LSD from three to 85 in the same period, and Ecstasy from 85 to 139. Mr Berry said the interceptions were generally smaller amounts, and did not indicate a similar increase in overall quantities being seized across all entry points to the country. About 2.4 million items of mail come into New Zealand every month.

### Sweden

On 27 June 2013, police reportedly stumbled on a suspicious man who dropped a package of pills and searched his trailer, discovering amphetamine, MDMA, & spice; this was the base of operations for the two men running the SR1 account "Speedsweden", which had made 500 sales ([police writeup](http://snpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SNPF_5-13.pdf "Speedsweden Ett Silk Road-ärende: En vaksam ledig kollega uppmärksammar av en slump hur två personer står och bryter på ett släp tidigt en morgon invid E20 strax söder om Alingsås. Det blir den osannolika upprinnelsen till ett grovt narkotikabrott med fler än tusen försäljningar över nätet.")/[translation](/docs/sr/anonymous-policewriteup-speedsweden.maff), [media article](http://www.metro.se/nyheter/29-aring-salde-knark-pa-silk-road/EVHmji!XXktv9EAmdGTI/ "29-åring sålde knark på Silk Road: Det var av en slump som polisen sprängde en knarkbutik på nätet. En husrannsakan avslöjade en 29-årig försäljare med kopplingar till den nedstängda knarksajten Silk Road.")).
The second one seems to have gotten off, however.

[2 Swedish men](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4uo/two_swedes_arrested_for_suspicion_of_selling_weed/) Jimmie Michael Juhlin & Mohammed Farid Aref Barham (the seller "SweExpress"), were arrested 8 October 2013 for selling marijuana, their packaging having apparently been profiled & their postal center surveilled ([court sentencing document](/docs/sr/sr-20140515-sweexpress-sentencing.pdf), [Flashback discussion](https://www.flashback.org/t2234859)); [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o03li/police_are_rounding_up_former_silk_road_drug/ccnobzx) [users](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4uo/two_swedes_arrested_for_suspicion_of_selling_weed/ccnmhh9) on Reddit noted that SweExpress ceased mailing orders a week before the SR raid.

<!-- "there's been several released court documents as of late regarding a Swedish vendor called SweExpress who was roughly in the top 4 % before the original Silk Road went bust, yet searching these forums no one is talking about that. I've been considering translating some of the court documents but I've simply been too busy to do so, the case is discussed in a major Swedish forum called Flashback over at the topic Helsingborgare, 29 och 34 år, häktade för att köpa/sälja på Silk Road: https://www.flashback.org/t2234859 One interesting tidbit from the documents is the fact law enforcement were staking out the postal center used by the two involved in the operation, thus managing to track over 100 packages and subsequent names and addresses." -->

### Thailand

The 54yo Canadian man Roger Thomas Clark ("Plural of Mongoose"/"Variety Jones"/"VJ"/"cimon") [was arrested in Thailand on 3 December 2015](http://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-arrest-and-unsealing-charges-against-senior-adviser "Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Arrest And Unsealing Of Charges Against Senior Adviser To The Operator Of The 'Silk Road' Website: Roger Thomas Clark Was a Key Figure in the Development of Silk Road Who Helped Ross Ulbricht Run the Criminal Enterprise") after a [complaint](http://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/file/797251/download) was filed in 21 April 2015 for extradition to the USA; as the SR1 seller Variety Jones, he had sold marijuana seeds and other materials, and as cimon, from December 2011 - October 2013 he was deeply involved in helping Ross Ulbricht run SR1, assisting in source code audits, management of servers & employees, and giving Ulbricht much advice (eg he suggested the "Dread Pirate Roberts" pseudonym to suggest the possibility of multiple DPRs, and pushed for Curtis Clark Green to be killed after Green was arrested & then his admin account used by Carl Mark Force IV to loot bitcoins from the SR1 servers).
The sheer extent of cimon's involvement in SR1 was documented during Ulbricht's January 2015 trial with excerpts from Ulbricht's journal, chat logs, and spreadsheets, leading to a great deal of surprise that cimon had apparently escaped unscathed, unlike many of the other SR1 employees, and especially considering that [La Moustache identified cimon as Roger Thomas Clark](http://antilop.cc/sr/#jones) shortly afterwards and even further, [hacks of DPR's abandoned email accounts](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/these-are-the-two-forgotten-architects-of-the-silk-road "These Are the Two Forgotten Architects of Silk Road") (due to unredacted passwords in the evidence exhibits for the Ulbricht trial) pointed to Clark as cimon and another Thai expat as the SR1 developer "Smedley". The complaint further reveals that Clark's photographic ID, like other SR1 employees, was stored on Ulbricht's laptop, and that Smedley was cooperating & had identified Clark.

The American man Mike Wattier (also a Thai expat associated with Clark) was identified as the SR1 programmer "Smedley" and began cooperating sometime between October 2013 and 21 April 2015.

### UK

Cambridge man [Callum Fay was arrested 28 June 2012](http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Pok-mon-cards-used-supply-drugs-international/story-26465044-detail/story.html "http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Pok-mon-cards-used-supply-drugs-international/story-26465044-detail/story.html") after UKBA intercepted an Indian package of cocaine and a search warrant was executed after delivery; Fay possessed cocaine, MDMA, methamphetamine, many packaging materials such as 20 internationally-addressed packages, and to have sold a great deal (£29,000) of bitcoins previously.
He was re-arrested 24 March 2015 for ketamine, heroin, and methamphetamine.
Given the Bitcoin volume and addressed packages, Fay was clearly an unknown SR1 seller.

A [Reddit user](http://www.reddit.com/user/xxcxcxc) [claims in June 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/27m64o/i_am_one_of_the_first_people_to_be_charged_with/?sort=old) to have been importing MDMA into the UK from the Netherlands off SR1 for personal consumption & resale through friends for ~6 months; sometime before 2013<!-- 'worst 18 months', posted 06 2014 --> a package of 100 pills was detected by customs and he accepted delivery, leading to his house being searched; he was then convicted (in large part due to text messages on his phone & emails on his computer) and given a suspended sentence.


After the SR bust in October 2013, the Devon UK seller of accessories like marijuana seeds/MBB+ packaging/[kratom](!Wikipedia) ("PlutoPete"), reported he had been [raided & questioned](/docs/sr/2013-10-03-plutopete.mht "Title: WARNING PLUTOPETE HAS BEEN RAIDED! MOVE YOUR DRUGS NOW; Post by: RR on October 03, 2013, 12:14 am") and likely charged with his personal drugs^["My solicitor is confidant [sic] I've broken no UK laws in selling my products, but they did find a small amount of class A and class B drugs that were for my own personal use so i will be charged with that at the very least."]; he was eventually charged in 2015 with ["9 charges inc conspiracy and supply class A and B"](https://twitter.com/plutopete/status/568016817534447616).
3 more in Manchester were [arrested & charged](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1nz4yl/four_men_arrested_in_uk_over_role_in_silk_road/); the description of a three-man seller mailing from Manchester seems to match at least two SR sellers, "JesusOfRave" and "TechnoHippy" (or possibly a "Mangled1"?), the former of whom [quickly denied being arrested](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1381.0;all), while the latter last appeared on the SR forums in mid-September 2013, he resurfaced on the SR2 forums [likewise denying any involvement](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=2889.0 "Technohippy is back! (and now verified)").

[At Peter Ward/PlutoPete's sentencing](http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Devon-man-partner-jailed-selling-drugs-dark-web/story-28829157-detail/story.html ), it came out that the second person was Richard Hiley, who was arrested in December 2013; they had been in partnership to buy & sell marijuana/methamphetamine/cocaine and exchange Bitcoins/dollars. They were sentenced 29 February 2016 to ~5 years each.

26yo Derby man [Adam Yates was raided](http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/Derby-worker-Toyota-bought-drugs-dark-web/story-29112765-detail/story.html "Derby Toyota worker bought drugs on 'dark web'") after a February 2014 intercept at Heathrow Airport of 50 MDMA tablets, turning up phone/computer evidence of purchases & local resale of MDMA/cocaine/ketamine back to December 2011, and was sentenced to 2 years (suspended) in April 2016.
The coverage identifies SR1 as his main DNM, but not which one he had ordered from in February 2014 (SR2?).

<!-- "I believe at least two of the vendors were based in Manchester, and I know one of them sold bitcoins for cash deposits to a bank account so if it is the vendor I am thinking of who got busted that's probably why." which one was that? -->
<!-- "There was a small UK vendor called something like Mangled1 who got busted.
Ordering a reship on a load of pills from the Netherlands to his house, the first shipment got caught. The second, the police replaced the pills with vitamins of the same colour. A few minutes after it was delivered they knocked down his door, he was sitting there surrounded by all his drugs, laptop, etc.
...They came on the forums after they'd been busted and said what had happened but I think all their posts got deleted soon after. They ordered (I think it was) 500, yellow supermans, don't which vendor and they probably didn't use their vendor account. He definitely ordered to the same address he lived and vended from.
Customs didn't do anything about the first package but when they caught the reship they raided him." probably referring to TheMangledOne2012 http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/a9d0046760.htm still active UK seller in the Hetu September 2013 crawl; but he was still selling on SR2 https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1xn0ie/themangledone2012_compromised_any_chance_i_can/ ‽ -->

### USA

In September 2011, the Silk Road 1 buyer of LSD & MDMA [Stacy Litz](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1v5g5u/september_2011_sr_prosecution_stacy_litz/) was arrested in Pennsylvania after reselling LSD to an undercover officer; she became an informant.

<!-- TODO: 2012, North Carolina: buyer for local resale busted, eventually got off https://www.reddit.com/r/IFfmbHfnpaZjKFvyi1okT/comments/302bkm/my_story/ -->

On 28 October 2013, the Maryland former seller ["digitalink"](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-digitalink-profile.html), Jacob Theodore George IV, was [charged in federal court](/docs/sr/digitalink-courtrecords.maff) (previously convicted of a number of offenses in state courts) for his heroin & [methylone](!Wikipedia) (banned October 2011) sales a year & a half previously (he stopped in January 2012), and [pled guilty](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-silk-road-plea-20131105,0,7979360.story "Silk Road drug dealer pleads guilty: Jacob T. George IV, 32, sold heroin and methylone using online market") ([plea agreement](/docs/sr/sr-digitalink-pleaagreement.pdf)), ultimately receiving [a sentence of 6 years](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-silk-road-sentencing-20140905,0,5703914.story "Silk Road drug dealer gets six years prison: Jacob Theodore George IV, 33, sold heroin through online marketplace").
The [complaint/indictment](/docs/sr/digitalink-federalcomplaint-1-13-cr-00593-CCB.pdf) does not specify what evidence the case is based on, why such a long delay, or why no arrest, and many of the PACER documents remain sealed or unavailable as of 23 February 2015 (so we don't know the details or how exactly he was cooperating); but based on [digitalink's forum posts](/docs/sr/digitalink-profile.maff) and [forum discussions of him](/docs/sr/digitalink-forumdiscussions.maff), it seems he was an extremely careless seller who disdained PGP, retrieved product seized by the Post Office (one forum-user presciently exclaimed in August 2011, "Oh wow, the idiocy is unmatched! It seems very possible that digitalink will be busted sometime soon."), told other people who his methylone supplier was, gave his phone number to buyers, and ultimately failed to deliver \$3500 of methylone to a buyer "thoth" who then [threatened to give digitalink's information to the police](/docs/sr/digitalink-thoth.maff), *possibly* resulting in him being interviewed and confessing to everything[^digitalink-plea].
[An internal timeline of the US investigations](http://ia801506.us.archive.org/27/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824.232.6.pdf) says that on 1 February 2012, "HSI Baltimore then revealed [in the meeting] that their informant that told them about the Silk Road in September was just arrested on or around January 17, 2012 for something unrelated and admitted to them then that he was actually a Silk Road vendor", so it seems digitalink were arrested for offline misbehavior unrelated to his heroin/methylone imports & sales, and only then flipped.

Another filing mentions the alllove account's use, but the internal timeline goes on to mention several other possible busts:

> On October 12, 2011, HSI Baltimore reported in ROI 13 in general case number BA08NR11BA0004 that in September of 2011 an informant told them that the Silk Road existed and they sold drugs there. No further reports were filed or subsequent cases opened on the website.
> - ...On December 8, 2011, HSI Headquarters prepared HSIR ID# ICE-HQINT-00431-12 titled "Digital Currency Bitcoin and the Underground Website Silk Road". In that report they list 6 HSI investigations that had mentioned the Silk Road, including HSI Chicago and HSI Baltimore. HSI Chicago's investigation was shown as actively working the website and multiple vendors. HSI Baltimore's summary was that of only having one report from a CI mentioning the Silk Road existed. The other 4 HSI cases had only mentioned the website from interviews conducted.
> - On January 03, 2012, HSI Baltimore SA Gregory Miller opened investigation BA13CR12BA0016 and stated in ROI 001 that on December 29, 2011, their CI began telling them some details about the Silk Road website.
> - ...By January 13, 2012, HSI Chicago had over 19 reports, 200 seizures, identified multiple vendors/targets, coordinated POE's and case information with multiple HSI attaché offices, signed up a CI and had met with the AUSA's office to prosecute the case.
> - ...In April of 2012, HSI Chicago developed a new informant and informed HSI Baltimore of development. HSI Baltimore requested access directly to the informant but wouldn't tell HSI Chicago why they wanted the access or what they wanted to ask the CI. HSI Chicago offered to take any questions and directly ask the CI the questions for them, but they would not allow access to the CI without knowing any topic of questions. HSI Baltimore expressed anger over not being allowed direct access to the CI.

The September 2011 informant seems to have not been a bust given the lack of any followup and to have simply been an informant (someone paid for money); the December report about "actively working...multiple vendors" may refer to investigating them and perhaps conducting undercover buys, not necessarily flipping them (in which case they might be referred to as CIs); the Baltimore claim of a CI dating from 29 December 2011 may seem to be "digitalink" but the date does not tally up with the other entry in which digitalink only offers to flip after his arrest almost a full month later and there are no known arrests near Baltimore in late 2011 (indeed, the only 2011 arrest so far is Stacy Litz from September 2011, which would be awkward as the CI - ~4 months to begin talking?), so I consider this evidence of an unknown bust in December 2011; the 13 January 2012 mention of a new CI in Chicago is also not consistent with any known busts and given the fierce rivalry between the Baltimore & Chicago offices (the focus of the timeline), this is likely another unknown bust; finally, the April 2012 mention of another new Chicago CI lines up almost perfectly with the known "dripsofacid" CI used by the Chicago office's Der-Yeghiayan from his testimony.
This leaves 2 unknown busts: the Baltimore CI in December 2011 and the Chicago CI in January 2012.

[^digitalink-plea]: The meat of his plea deal is sealed, but it does say

    > In January 2012, the defendant voluntarily admitted to federal agents with Homeland Securities Investigations that he acquired and sold drugs as described above. He voluntarily granted investigators access to emails, postal shipping records, financial accounts, and other information that corroborated these sales.

    This phrasing is, however, also consistent with common scenarios such as being raided and agreeing to cooperate.

During the SR1 trial, the DHS agent Deryeghiayan engaged in purchases ["from March 2012 until September 2013...Using an account obtained from an actual user, with the screen name of 'dripsofacid'"](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2870812/us-government-lurked-on-silk-road-for-over-a-year.html "U.S. government lurked on Silk Road for over a year"), which was used for [at least one buy in April 2013](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/silk-road-trial-federal-agent-explains-how-he-trapped-ulbricht/); "dripsofacid"'s account may have been obtained after an unknown arrest during that time period.
(Another LE account was "Mr Wonderful", who was used in the 2013 "Emailgate" in which he canvassed SR1 employees over Tormail and tried to flip them by offering money and immunity, to which DPR1 was alerted by his DEA informant Carl Force; Mr Wonderful is not a known seller account, and all mentions of Mr Wonderful such as Force's dismissive comments seem to be imply his contact was done off SR1 and to be a fresh pseudonym, so it does not sound like a flipped buyer or seller to me and so is not included in the table.
Similarly, an FBI presentation in mid-April 2015 in the Netherlands had a screenshot taken with the account "Aspire28", but my searches do not turn up mentions of any seller of that name, so it was probably a throwaway or flipped buyer - impossible to know.)

On 5 May 2012, the Massachusetts [Bard College student](http://www.berkshireeagle.com/news/ci_26681481/former-bard-college-at-simons-rock-student-avoids "Former Bard College at Simon's Rock student avoids jail on drug charges") Mehran Jahedi's rooms were searched & campus security found "LSD, ketamine, amphetamines, hallucinogenic mushrooms, MDMA, mescaline and marijuana, as well as packaging originating from as far away as China, Germany and Poland", which he had been reselling locally after sourcing them from the "darknet", and ultimately received a suspended sentence in 2014; given the variety, it is almost certain he was purchasing from SR1 rather than any of the other SR1-era markets (BMR/Darkbay/Sheep/Atlantis).

The account of the SR1 clonazepam/marijuana seller "alllove" was used by the FBI in 27 September 2012 & earlier as part of its investigation into SR1, and [screenshots taken with it](/docs/sr/ulbrichttrial-evidence-gx109redacted.pdf) were [entered into evidence](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2014_12_10_ULBRICHT_evidence_lists.pdf) at Ross Ulbricht's 2015 trial.
alllove must have been busted somehow before September 2012, for his account to have become the FBI's property, and explaining his abrupt disappearance sometime before 19 May 2012 (remarked upon at the time [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1emvyg/favorite_vendors/); there may be more accurate timings in [SR1F hits for "alllove"](/docs/sr/sr1f-alllove.tar.xz)) but all other details are unknown.
[One post-trial exhibit](http://ia801506.us.archive.org/27/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824/gov.uscourts.nysd.422824.232.1.pdf "Case 1:14-cr-00068-KBF Document 232-1 Filed 04/16/15 Page 1 of 11; Exhibit 1") (a Der-Yeghiayan affidavit seeking copies of Mark Karpeles's email accounts) states that "In September of 2012, HSI was able to verify that a commission rate exists on the Silk Road by using a Silk Road vendor account and setting a price on a product for sale on the Silk Road marketplace. HSI then logged in to the Silk Road using a different account and observed the same product offered for sale at a higher price than what was set by the vendor. The difference in price matched the advertised commission rates from the Silk Road administrator."; while this could possibly have been an unknown seller, digitalink, davidd, or alllove (all USA SR1 seller accounts compromised by September 2012), the former had disappeared off the market by September 2012, and the last fits best given that we know the alllove account was being used for other parts of the investigation.
(The [old SR1 seller Grand Wizard says](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/2uxzus/sr1_seller_alllove_busted_mid2012/coczhg6) that alllove may also have sold bitcoins for cash in the mail or other fiat; this is an extremely risky occupation and if true, almost certainly how he was busted.)

In December 2012, a [New Jersey buyer was busted for marijuana in a controlled delivery](http://www.news10.net/news/article/251775/2/Cross-county-drug-ring-using-dark-Internet-site-busted-by-feds) when the package was detected in the mail; he cooperated (no additional penalties specified in article) and 2 sellers (SourDieselMan) were eventually arrested & charged in July 2013.

SR forum posters have claimed that a [DMT seller, cocaine seller, & 2 others](/docs/sr/2013-04-16-dmt.mht "Title: Curious about SR Vendor busts Post by: mollyexpress on April 16, 2013, 06:06 am") have all been busted but apparently for their offline connections and activities (the poster claims the DMT seller had too many people visiting and his neighbors squealed; this was likely the Canadian seller "Trojan", but the other 3 I'm not sure about).

In "early 2013" (personal communication), an American ordered MDMA from a European seller; IRL activities led to his arrest (he had been reselling locally and one of his buyers was themselves caught & snitched) although the SR1 connection was not uncovered, and eventually he pled to a lesser charge.

In January 2013, according to the SR bust indictments, a seller & SR employee ("chronic pain"/"chronicpain"/"Flush")  was arrested & charged in Maryland after receiving a kilo of cocaine from an undercover agent; he then cooperated with the FBI in entrapping Ulbricht into ordering a hit on him and then pretending to be dead.
[He was identified in October as Curtis Clark Green](http://antilop.cc/sr/#assassination_plot) ([discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1po2og/silk_road_tales_and_archives_another_bad_opsec/)).
Green's [plea-agreement](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/releases/2013/131107baltimore1.pdf) ([transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1q4vic/the_maryland_employee_is_revealed_pleading_guilty/cd9bmpm)) was [released on 7 November 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118015343/http://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Man-pleads-guilty-to-playing-key-drug-site-role-4964858.php), without any details of his cooperation after his arrest in Utah (although ["the U.S. attorney's office said his computer was forensically examined after it was seized"](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-silk-road-employee-20131107,0,5353243.story)); interestingly, the plea-agreement notes that the undercover agent did not know the cocaine package was being delivered to the same SR administrator who had helped him find a seller for his cocaine.
Curtis Green's cooperation earned him [2 days imprisonment & 4 years probation](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/murdered-silk-road-employee-sentenced-to-time-served "'Murdered' Silk Road Employee Sentenced to Time Served").

Also in January 2013, [the criminal complaint](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/30/criminal_complaint_force.pdf) documenting the DEA corruption during the SR1 investigation mentions offhandedly that the dirty copes Force & Bridge controlled the account "TrustusJones" as of 23 January 2013[^Force-TrustusJones]; TrustusJones was an East Coast marijuana SR1 seller beginning around February 2012 ([forum archive](/docs/sr/sr1f-trustusjones.tar.xz)).
Curiously, in February 2013, the account announced on the SR1 forums (thread #118718) that he would be selling off all his bitcoins (at ~30% off) in exchange for MoneyPak; this might sound like Force laundering coins from the January 2013 theft, except the use of TrustusJones is noted in internal DEA documents, suggesting that the sales were more about busting any SR1 users unwise enough to buy MoneyPak. (The original TrustusJones had even mocked MoneyPak in an earlier thread, #16083.)
It's unclear when exactly TJ was busted or how; my best guess, [based on his SR1F posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/30zdvj/dea_controlled_vendor_trustusjones_sells_his_btc/cq86d53), is that he was busted on or before 29 April 2012, and his OPSEC sounded good, it was probably due to the usual mail-tracing approach.

[^Force-TrustusJones]: Key quote:

    > I believe that BRIDGES controlled and/or had access with others to "Number13", the account that appears to have initiated the sizeable bitcoin thefts. I believe this for at least two reasons. First, in a DEA 6 that FORCE authored dated January 23, 2013 , FORCE described how he had transferred 60 bitcoins into a DEA-controlled account known as "TrustUsJones". Data from the Silk Road servers demonstrates that on that January 23, 2013 date, there was a 60 bitcoin transfer from "Number13" into "TrustUsJones". Second, in an email dated January 23, 2013, FORCE emailed BRIDGES requesting that BRIDGES deposit bitcoins to replenish the "TrustUsJones" account. In other words, BRIDGES, in consultation with FORCE, appears to have been controlling "Number13" during the late January 2013 timeframe.

In February 2013, there were two cases of Americans being busted in [Florida](http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2013/feb/22/man-arrested-after-accepting-drug-package-mail/ "Deputies: Man arrested after accepting drug package through mail") and [Loui](http://www.wwltv.com/news/Laundry-List-of-Drugs-at-Uptown-Frat-House-Leads-to-Tulane-Student-Arrests-193450441.html "Laundry list of drugs at Uptown frat house leads to Tulane student arrests")[siana](http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2013/02/tulane_students_arrested_after.html "Tulane students arrested after allegedly accepting drug delivery at frat house") by signing for MDMA in what is called a ["controlled delivery"](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22controlled+delivery%22&as_sdt=2%2C21); the simultaneity, drug type, & amount immediately led to speculation that they were both ordering from the SR MDMA Canadian seller ["luckylucianno"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/a773f1b769.htm) who was previously having issues with order interceptions, which was confirmed when one of the arrested men posted on the SR forums warning away others and [relevant threads were deleted by forum moderators](https://web.archive.org/web/20131211213539/http://weirderweb.com/2013/02/26/florida-man-busted-silk-road-promptly-deletes-all-his-posts/) (although a moderator claimed the Louisiana bust was unrelated to SR or the Florida bust).

Sometime in March 2013, an Alaskan buyer of heroin & cocaine apparently received a controlled delivery, and received felony charges; he cooperated in the ongoing investigation of his seller, "NOD", according to the indictment for NOD.

An otherwise-unknown female buyer from NOD seems to have been similarly arrested in April/May according to the [TSG](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/silk-road-dealer-cooperating-567432) article on NOD.

On 21 March 2013, the large Californian marijuana group seller "SourDieselMan" replaced their profile page with the message "i am down forever" (last forum comment was 18 March 2013); SR users noted that on 19 March, [a series of marijuana-related raids were executed in California](http://www.willitsnews.com/ci_22836369/six-arrested-3-000-marijuana-plants-and-44 "Humboldt & Sonoma counties: Six arrested, 3,000 marijuana plants and 44 weapons seized in state DOJ raids") near where SourDieselMan apparently shipped from, and [speculate that SourDieselMan may have been arrested in them](/docs/sr/2013-10-26-sourdieselmanreviews.mht "Title: Sourdieselman Official Review thread; Post by: sourdieselman on June 26, 2012, 05:40 pm") (though [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1bfmki/who_replaces_sourdieselman/c96otz1) [users](http://silkroad5v7dywlc.onion/index.php?topic=1381.msg17659#msg17659) say SourDieselMan was either banned by SR over selling Bitcoins for cash in the mail or traced via this, an activity attested to in the review thread).
[Additional July news coverage](http://www.kcra.com/news/mailorder-marijuana-postal-inspectors-link-operation-to-sac-region/-/11797728/21156348/-/nv5v6u/-/index.html "Mail-order marijuana? Postal inspectors link operation to Sac region: Loomis man, Roseville woman face charges") revealed SourDieselMan to be a group, 2 members of which (Matthew Gillum & Jolene Chan) were arrested & charged with marijuana & finance-related charges.
[The complaint](/docs/sr/2013-07-23-sourdieselman-gillum-complaint.pdf) says the investigation started in August 2012 due to the large sums of cash in mail, did a controlled delivery to a SR marijuana buyer in New Jersey in December 2012 (he cooperated), flipped one of the SourDieselMan members, and went from there; for additional details, see the [PACER court records](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-courtrecords.maff) and the filings for [Gillum](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-gillum-documents.zip) & [Chan](/docs/sr/2013-11-05-sourdieselman-chan-documents.zip).
Gillum was sentenced to [9 years](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/crime/article43517145.html "Meadow Vista marijuana distributor sentenced to prison in federal court").

On 12 April 2013, a [South Carolinian man](https://web.archive.org/web/20140211094519/http://letstalkbitcoin.com/users-bitcoins-seized-by-dea/) ([the seller "Casey Jones"](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1gxiv7/srrelated_bitcoin_seizure/caoxlmg), judging by [forum search hits](/docs/sr/2013-06-srforums-caseyjonessearch.html.maff)[^MAFF] and his [posts](/docs/sr/2013-06-truckingcaseyjones.html.maff "Trucking's SR forum posts")) had ฿11 (then \$935) confiscated via a drug law provision ([Hughes blames](http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20130709/PC16/130709464/1177/lawyer-charleston-man-denies-connection-to-dea-bitcoin-seizure-and-illicit-silk-road-drug-marketplace "Lawyer: Charleston man denies connection to DEA Bitcoin seizure and illicit Silk Road drug marketplace") it on the "actions of one of his house guests" and [an additional Bitcoin seizure](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/dea-seizes-bitcoin-seizure-points-to-earlier-mistaken-identity "DEA Seizes Bitcoin: Seizure Points to Earlier Mistaken Identity ") casts a little doubt on the charges); he was arrested in June 2013 and triply charged in Charleston with distribution/possession of marijuana/clonazepam/DMT/methylone but he did not seem to be selling marijuana on SR and the [available court records](/docs/sr/2013-08-20-hughescourtrecords.html.maff) do not indicate whether he is being charged due to offline or online drug dealing, but the mention of "two undercover drug buys...in April" imply he was selling off-SR and may have been caught that way.

On 26 April 2013, 2 Iowan men, Adam Lawin & Benjamin Walker, [were](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/one-sentenced-in-silk-road-drug-case/article_7b014078-0499-575d-8e31-356bb431ca94.html "One sentenced in Silk Road drug case") [raided](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/waterloo-man-pleads-guilty-to-selling-ecstacy/article_a57aab93-b9c5-5e3e-8438-6e229c9bd036.html "Waterloo man pleads guilty to selling Ecstasy") [for](http://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/second-person-pleads-in-silk-road-ecstasy-case/article_f83869f2-6011-57be-a38a-90221545dd92.html "Second person pleads in Silk Road ecstasy case") importing MDMA from the UK & Belgium ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/ian/news/2014/feb_14/2_10_14_Lawin.html); [sentencing](/docs/sr/2014-lawin-sentencing-iand07501568757.pdf)).
Customs interceptions of their packages beginning in 2012 were followed by a local undercover buy, which triggered the raid.

During May 2013, a [teen in Indiana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160708/http://www.theindychannel.com/news/call-6-investigators/fishers-teen-admits-buying-drugs-on-dark-net-hidden-online-market "Fishers teen admits buying drugs on 'Dark Net', hidden online market: Mom turned son, drugs over to police") was arrested after his mother informed on him.
I also know of another case involving an American who was convicted after a controlled delivery of LSD mailed from the Netherlands; his package was likely detected.

[A complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/handel_indictment.pdf) filed 13 June 2013 against a David Lawrence Handel charges him with distributing methylone, 2C-E, and 2C-C; no full complaint is available and it is apparently sealed.
Handel is known to be SR-related because the edgarnumbers complaint says so.^["There are several related cases. The owner and operator of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht [DPR], is charged with Murder for hire...Other individuals charged in the District of Maryland connection with the Marco Polo task force include Jacob Theodore George IV (CCB-13-0593) [Digitalink], Curtis Clark Green (CCB-13-0592) [Chronicpain], and David Lawrence Handel (CCB-13-0313) [???]. Other individuals have been charged with crimes involving from Silk Road in jurisdictions around the United States and in foreign countries."]
[La Moustache suggests](http://antilop.cc/sr/#the_silk_road_travellers) that Handel was the research-chemical seller [daviddd](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/cdd8e9e8d9.html), based on davidd's sales volume, public silence since the right time, a rumor that he had been arrested, the coincidence that davidd listed 1kg of methylone for sale just like the LE-controlled Digitalink & edgarnumbers seller profiles had, and a suspicious attempt by the davidd attempt to send a 'free sample' to a SR1 moderator.
This identification as the SR1 seller davidd was eventually confirmed when Handel [pled guilty in 2015](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/dealer-pleads-guilty-to-selling-drugs-on-the-silk-road/) ([plea agreement](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2015_01_29_HANDEL_plea_agreement.pdf); [sentencing order](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2015_01_29_HANDEL_sentencing_order.pdf)).
He had been the target of several undercover buys by the Maryland Marco Polo task force which led to his profiling & identification; he was arrested after picking up a package from post office, was carrying a gun, apartment was searched, and wound up handing over his SR1 seller account.

On 28 June 2013, the seller Sheldon Kennedy ("edgarnumbers"; [profile](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-edgarnumbers-profile.html)) was raided in Nebraska (he had sold methylone among others on SR, and guns on the short-lived Armory); he cooperated (turning over his customers' addresses), was eventually [officially arrested 19 February 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140223041104/http://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/Neb-man-charged-in-Silk-Road-case-5253111.php "Neb. man charged in Silk Road case"), and his case was unsealed the next day ([complaint](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/sheldon_kennedy_criminal_complaint.pdf)), finally being sentenced to a reduced [two years](http://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/silk-road-vendor-sentenced-two-years-prison "Silk Road Vendor Sentenced to Two Years In Prison: Sold Drugs, Guns and Counterfeit Currency Using the Online Marketplace Silk Road").
He had been busted after "digitalink"^[The complaint calls the source "CS-1", but given the date November 2011, the presence of methylone, the mention of spending counterfeit in Baltimore, and his arrest, it is highly unlikely that CS-1 is anyone other than digitalink.] turned over all his customers' addresses in November 2011, which included edgarnumbers's address; he was then targeted for undercover buys and confirmation that he was a drug & gun dealer through his lack of visible income, Gmail & Amazon accounts, Facebook & Google+ profiles, interviews at his local post office & debit card records of many postal purchases, and a return address.[^Kennedy-excerpts-1][^Kennedy-excerpts-2]
(Kennedy [turns out to be](https://twitter.com/embot/status/654173415964700672) the SR1 seller mentioned in an article on [the Internet sex-cam site Chaturbate](https://medium.com/matter/are-you-internet-sexual-1f855e113df).)

[^Kennedy-excerpts-1]: Some relevant excerpts from the complaint:

    > Starting in November 2011, agents with Homeland Security Investigations conducted several interviews with a source in Maryland (CS-1) [Digitalink?]. CS-1 had been selling illegal drugs on Silk Road. CS-1 explained how Silk Road worked to the agents, and voluntarily provided access to CS-1's Silk Road accounts, email accounts, and Bitcoin accounts that documented CS-1's own involvement in Silk Road. CS-1's computer was also found to contain CS-1's "customer records", including names and addresses of hundreds of individuals (in the United States and other countries) that received drug shipments from CS-1. [CS-1 was initially not truthful about being a drug dealer on Silk Road. CS-1 was also arrested because he continued to use illegal drugs after his first interview with agents. However, the information provided by CS-1 relied upon in this affidavit has been corroborated by agents' review of the CS-1's Silk Road and email accounts, and files contained on CS-1's computer.]
    >
    > ...Among the information provided by CS-1, were records of drugs sold to Sheldon Kennedy, using the alias "edgarnumbers", and shipped to 2222 N. Cotner Blvd, Lincoln, Nebraska, 68505 (the "Residence")...Undercover agents also communicated with Kennedy and made purchases from Kennedy on Silk Road using aliases (including the online identity of CS-1). Kennedy sold these products via Silk Road under the alias "edgarnumbers". These purchases were made from product Kennedy listed as available for sale on Silk Road, and were paid for in Bitcoin. In each case, Kennedy shipped the contraband from Nebraska to an undercover agent in Maryland
[^Kennedy-excerpts-2]: Social media:

    > ...Agents queried Kennedy on www.facebook.com and discovered a publicly available profile identified as "Sheldon Kennedy"...Kennedy had made posts on his Facebook page stating he had firearms for sale...On June 28, 2013, a federal search warrant was executed at Kennedy's residence...After signing a written _Miranda_ form, Kennedy also made a voluntary statement to investigators. He admitted he started selling drugs and guns on Silk Road in Summer 2011. He admitted to selling a variety of drugs via Silk Road, including cocaine, methylone, and prescription medication. Kennedy advised that he buys narcotics from China, India, and Serbia. Kennedy admitted to obtaining 24 grams of cocaine from an online vendor which was "fronted". He said he split up the 24 grams and sold them on Silk Road and made approximately \$2,500 to \$3,000
    >
    > ...Kennedy admitted to selling drugs on the Silk Road. He also admitted to selling firearms through Silk Road. Kennedy also voluntarily provided agents with control of his Silk Road account, email accounts, and electronic records showing shipping information (including name and address) for Kennedy's sales of drugs and/or firearms. Kennedy also provided control of his financial accounts used to facilitate his criminal activity, including an account [on] the online Bitcoin exchange mtgox.com. A review of these accounts corroborated Kennedy's statement.

In July 2013 [according to DHS agent DerYeghiayan's testimony](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/silk-road-trial-undercover-dhs-fbi-trap-ross-ulbricht/), the Texas seller and then SR1 employee ["CaptainMal"/"scout"/"cirrus"](http://antilop.cc/sr/#flotsam)'s account was taken over by law enforcement and the account used to infiltrate SR1 and later SR2; she was likely arrested at some point before that in June or July 2013 on some charge (possibly relating to her activity as a seller selling bitcoins, although an LE agent may have implied she got in trouble for something unrelated to SR1 and offered to flip).
Cirrus has been suspected long before as there were only a few suspects for the UC who was reported in October 2013 as chatting with Ulbricht as he was arrested, but the hard confirmation came [when the evidence list was leaked](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-evidence-list/) 19 December 2014.

On 11 July 2013, [two young Algoma, Wisconsin men](https://archive.is/RSm0o "Two men charged with delivery of designer drug http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20130906/GPG1008/309060102/Two-men-charged-delivery-designer-drug  http://archive.greenbaypressgazette.com/article/20130906/GPG1008/309060102/Two-men-charged-delivery-designer-drug"), J.J. Savoie & S.J. Paape [importing MDMA from Germany](/docs/sr/2013-10-26-wisconsinmdma.maff) ([mugshot](http://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Wisconsin/Marathon-County-WI/Soren-J-Paape.76687428.html)) - possibly from Afterhour? - saw their package detected by Customs and received a controlled delivery.

Also on 24 July 2013, the Wisconsin [SR1](https://www.facebook.com/brookfieldelmgrovenow/posts/10152350274394314 "Ryan Petersen, 21, told police he ordered ecstasy online from Silk Road") buyer Ryan M Petersen [was searched](http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/258970501.html "Brookfield man pleads not guilty of manufacturing drugs") [over an](http://fox6now.com/2014/03/24/brookfield-man-faces-multiple-charges-related-to-drugs-trafficking/ "Brookfield man faces multiple charges related to drugs, trafficking") intercepted package of MDMA from Belgium, after his friend he was using as a drop had been searched after an earlier 26 April 2013 CD (he then cooperated).
He eventually reached a plea bargain ([court records #2014CF000288](/docs/sr/sr1-petersen-courtrecords.pdf))

A [New York man Nicholas C Moffitt was prosecuted in August 2013](http://poststar.com/news/local/police-queensbury-shop-owner-bought-drugs-on-silk-road-website/article_8f45d126-0c1f-11e3-a590-001a4bcf887a.html "Police: Queensbury shop owner bought drugs on Silk Road website") after selling Suboxone in person, having his mail monitored, and then his store (with drugs on the premises) raided; he [pled guilty](http://poststar.com/news/blotter/former-computer-shop-operator-pleads-guilty-to-drug-charges/article_b42b976e-8bf9-11e3-a353-001a4bcf887a.html "Former computer shop operator pleads guilty to drug charges")

Also in August 2013, the large Dutch MDMA seller SuperTrips was arrested ([forfeiture](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01a.pdf); [press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/iln/pr/chicago/2014/pr0424_01.html); [plea agreement](/docs/sr/sr1-supertrips-pleaagreement.pdf)); profiling of his packages and fingerprints provided enough grounds that when he tried to visit the USA, he was detained at the airport, his unencrypted laptop examined and all his records found (including all buyer addresses), whereupon he confessed & began cooperating (helping bust his collaborator UnderGroundSyndicate in October 2013).
(His account would be [used by a DHS undercover agent](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/01/silk-road-trial-federal-agent-explains-how-he-trapped-ulbricht/) until SR1 was raided 2 months later.)
He was sentenced to [10 years prison](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-28/silk-road-s-biggest-drug-dealer-sentenced-to-10-years-in-prison "Silk Road's Top Drug Dealer Gets Prison as Dread Pirate Up Next").

Also in September 2013, a [Vermont student Sid Hammer was charged with drug possession](https://web.archive.org/web/20140518105328/http://www.vermontcynic.com/news/student-busted-for-silk-road-purchase-1.2841435 "Student busted for Silk Road purchase"); he had purchased them off SR for [local resale](http://www.wptz.com/news/vermont-new-york/burlington/bitcoin-boom/23169748), and was reported to police through complaints of "smells of burnt marijuana".

In October 2013, the founder of SR, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested in San Francisco and charged with a laundry list of crimes; he was ultimately convicted and [sentenced to life without parole](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/silk-road-creator-ross-ulbricht-sentenced-life-prison/ "Silk Road Creator Ross Ulbricht Sentenced to Life in Prison").
Logs from his laptop implicated a college friend, Richard Bates ("baronsyntax") in helping program SR1 and buying some drugs; this was used as leverage to force Bates to testify against Ulbricht in his trial.
Reportedly there were, besides NOD, Ulbricht, 4 UKers and 2 Swedes, ["at least half a dozen other arrests currently in the works"](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/silk-road/) (a promise fulfilled subsequently).

Simultaneous with the SR bust, a [Washington](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-heroin-arrest-nod/  "The rise and fall of Silk Road's heroin kingpin") [state man](http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Federal-drug-charges-for-Bellevue-man-involved-in-Silk-Road-226387671.html "Federal drug charges for Bellevue man involved in 'Silk Road'") & his girlfriend, the seller "NOD", was charged with heroin selling ([complaint](http://cryptome.org/2013/10/sadler-white-complaint.pdf), [docket](https://ia801904.us.archive.org/18/items/gov.uscourts.wawd.196180/gov.uscourts.wawd.196180.docket.html), [interview](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-confession-steven-sadler-nod/)) with some leniency since [they cooperated after their July bust](http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/silk-road-dealer-cooperating-567432 "Top Silk Road Drug Dealer Was Flipped By Feds: Online narcotics kingpin 'Nod' began cooperating after July raid") & was sentenced to (a perhaps surprisingly low) [5 years](http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/bellevue-man-who-sold-drugs-silk-road-internet-site-sentenced-drug-distribution "Bellevue Man who Sold Drugs on 'Silk Road' Internet Site Sentenced for Drug Distribution Conspiracy: Top Seller on Silk Road Used Screen Name 'Nod'").
A [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/) claims to have been a customer of NOD, among other sellers, and to have been searched, arrested & charged on 8 October 2013, with (apparently) another [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/ccpo1f1) reporting state charges & posting his indictment. (Interestingly, NOD may have done a interview for the [_Drugs Inc._](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1oy6yr/did_anyone_else_notice_nod_was_in_the_drugs_inc/) TV series somewhere around March 2013.)

The Florida seller "UnderGroundSyndicate"/"BTCMaster" Angel William Quinones ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/8184c05ea4.htm), [plea agreement](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2014_05_13_QUINONES_plea_agreement.pdf)) [was arrested](http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/27419179-418/partner-of-ex-largest-online-drug-dealer-plans-to-plead-guilty.html "Partner of ex-largest online drug dealer plans to plead guilty") near-simultaneously with DPR thanks to the cooperation of his partner/supplier, the Dutch seller SuperTrips, who had been arrested when he earlier tried to fly into the USA in August 2013 with an unencrypted laptop after having been identified through latent fingerprints on packaging.

The NY seller of clonazepam/hydrocodone/heroin "deezletime" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/f70952f167.htm)), Michael Duch, was arrested on 1 October 2013 as well, ultimately reaching a plea deal on 10 December 2014, in time to testify in the Ulbricht trial.
In exchange for his testimony, he was sentenced to [2.5 years in July 2015](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/21/us-usa-bitcoin-trial-idUSKCN0PV2FG20150721 "Silk Road drug dealer turned government witness gets 2-1/2 years in prison") (most already served).

On 21 November 2013, the seller "MDpro" was [arrested in Delaware](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-silk-road-orlando-doctor-20131121,0,5782126.story "Doctor charged with selling drugs to local DEA agents via Silk Road") ([seller profile](/docs/sr/2013-06-07-mdpro-profile.html), [forum discussions](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-srforums-discussion.maff), [forum posts](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-forumposts.maff), [BMR posts under her real name](/docs/sr/2013-11-29-bmr-obollesforum.mht)) and charged in federal court ([PACER web data](/docs/sr/2013-11-11-mdpro-pacer.maff), [complaint/filings](/docs/sr/2013-11-22-mdpro-6-13-mj-01614-DAB.zip)), ultimately sentenced to [2.5 years](http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/local/2015/01/13/doctor-sentenced-months-silk-road-drug-case/21716135/ "Doctor gets 30 months in Silk Road drug case"); based on the complaint, it seems her fatal mistake was either using tracking on her shipments through an account registered in her real name or putting valid return addresses on her shipments to a PO box registered to her real name, which allowed the undercover buyer to find her and compile the extensive case against her. Among her [many security mistakes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/26/how-a-delaware-doctor-was-linked-to-silk-road-drug-sales/) included [accepting shipments from other sellers](/docs/sr/2013-11-29-mdpro-moonbear.mht) to her apartment addressed to her partner (and [partner in crime](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Del-doc-32-busted-sold-drugs-for-Bitcoins.html "Ob/Gyns who planned to wed busted in Bitcoin drug probe")).

On 17 December 2013, 4 members of the methamphetamine group seller ["hammertime"](/docs/sr/hammertime-profile.htm) [were arrested in Oregon](http://www.kgw.com/news/Wash-county-tactical-police-conducting-3-dawn-raids-236190011.html "Suspected drug trafficking ring busted in Aloha") as well as 3 others charged ([PACER](/docs/sr/2013-12-19-hammertime-pacer.maff), [indictment](/docs/sr/2013-12-10-hammertime-indictment.pdf); [more coverage](http://www.dailydot.com/crime/silk-road-meth-ring-4-arrests/ "4 arrested in Silk Road meth ring bust, alleged leader faces life in prison"); [trial](http://www.golocalpdx.com/news/portland-is-a-hub-for-online-drug-dealers); [plea agreement](/docs/sr/2015-02-17-hammertime-pleadeal.pdf); [sentencing for two](http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/08/players_in_biggest_silk_road_m.html "Players in biggest Silk Road meth operation sentenced in Portland U.S. court")).
The leader, Jason Weld Hagen, was [ultimately sentenced to 3 years](http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/11/global_silk_road_meth_dealer_f.html "Global meth dealer from Vancouver gets lighter sentence because of U.S. agents' 'Silk Road' corruption"); the cited reason for such a light sentence was concerns over the Force/Bridges SR1 corruption scandal.

<!-- I have some background info on hammertime's downfall.
Don't ask me where I got this information, but this is what happened.
So, hammertime and his associates sold a lot of meth, not unlike myself. Pretty good meth too, by most accounts.
Once he'd begun to make a name for himself as a reliable meth vendor he discovered Australia, just like I did.
Meth goes for as much as $600 a gram in some parts of aus, so the demand for inexpensive American meth is almost unfathomable to somebody unfamiliar with the market.
Anyway, USPS to aus is fucking awful. I personally had two orders to the same buyer/drop, one first class mail and the other priority mail express international, show up within hours of each other.
FedEx is way better, but it's a private courier - making it very difficult to send packages anonymously (liability reasons, since they're a private company unlike USPS).
I don't have much experience with FedEx to aus but I know that when all goes according to plan it's fucking incredible. NYC to Perth is 4 days awesome, unheard of with USPS.
So, hammertime was making a killing selling meth in the states, and had begun to expand into the gaping maw-like profit margins of the aus market.
He disguised his packages as legal documents, from a real law firm in the united states. I don't know if he actually had access to their FedEx account (authorized or otherwise) or if he just used their real business location as a return address, but after some time something went wrong. If I recall correctly, it didn't even have anything to do with Australian customs (notoriously nosy fuckers as many of you already know), even they don't want to fuck with lawyers.. Some little thing happened, like the guy who made this particular order freaked out and wouldn't sign for it, or the address was fake, or an abandoned house.. something that wouldn't normally cause anything more than a 1/5 feedback. But in this instance, because FedEx is actually an efficient courier service, when the error (whatever it was) was discovered, the "documents" were promptly returned to the real law firm, that the "documents" allegedly came from. If I remember correctly, this is one of those gigantic SUPER evil law firms that defend multi-billion dollar companies when they get sued for giving Ecuadorian toddlers cancer or what have you. Well not evil, but I'm sure they have enough enemies. Now, this international package is returned to them, and at some point some secretary opens it up to try and figure out where it was supposed to go and why, almost immediately discovering about two ounces of a mysterious white substance.
ANTHRAX, is the immediate assumption that is made, not recognizing the ground shards as methamphetamine. As soon as the word "anthrax" is uttered, DHS and every other big scary three letter government organization gets involved. They soon realize it is not anthrax but actually crystal methamphetamine, but it's too late for them to be distracted at this point. Within a week they've obtained security footage of HT sending that exact parcel at a FedEx store, and if they hadn't figured out who it was yet, I assume they just traced the card he paid with. And that was game over for HT.
TL DR: Lawyers + DHS + Fear of Anthrax = stuff of nightmares.
Disclaimer: This is my best attempt to recall 2nd hand memories and I'm sure there are a few inaccuracies in need of correction, but it's the best I can recall. -->

On [19 December 2013](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR.php) ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December13/JonesetalArrestsSilkRoad2PR/Jones,%20Andrew,%20et%20al%20\(Silk%20Road\)%20Indictment.pdf); [girlfriend's report](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1tb2yl/sr_admin_and_mod_just_got_arrestedmy_boyfriend/)), the former SR administrator/employee "Inigo" was arrested in Virginia.

On 26 January 2014, the Bitcoin seller "BTCKing" ([SR1](/docs/sr/btcking-profile-1.htm)/[2](/docs/sr/btcking-profile-2.htm)) & an accomplice at [BitInstant](!Wikipedia) were arrested in Florida & NY (respectively) after an IRS investigation ([indictment](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January14/SchremFaiellaChargesPR/Faiella,%20Robert%20M.%20and%20Charlie%20Shrem%20Complaint.pdf)); BTCKing offered a service in which he sent buyers a bank account number to deposit cash to (which he then converted into bitcoins via BitInstant), then transferred bitcoins to the buyer on Silk Road.
He was arrested after an undercover agent (starting in August 2012) made purchases, received the bank account information, and obtained his bank records; the case was further cemented by using the SR messages from the FBI's copy of the servers (apparently BTCKing did not believe in using PGP), the home IP embedded in BTCKing's emails with BitInstant (BTCKing used Safe-mail.net but apparently did not connect over Tor), and his accomplice's Gmail emails & chats obtained.
(Ironically, BTCKing had declined Dread Pirate Robert's July 2013 invitation to join him in creating an "Anonymous Bitcoin Exchange" by pointing out his vulnerability to investigation: "All LE has to do is go to the bank and ask who is the Trustee of RMF Trust and BANG... They will seize the funds and me.")
He pled guilty and was [sentenced to 4 years](http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/January15/RobertFaiellaSentencingPR.php "Bitcoin Exchanger Sentenced In Manhattan Federal Court To Four Years In Prison For Selling Nearly $1 Million In Bitcoins For Drug Buys On Silk Road")

In late May 2014, the SR1 oxycodone/hydrocodone seller "CALIGIRL" ([profile](/docs/sr/caligirl-profile.htm)), Matthew Jones, was [arrested in Dallas, Texas](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2014-05-30/news/os-silk-road-arrest-matthew-jones-20140530_1_dea-agents-painkillers-website) ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones.html), [criminal complaint](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/May/20140530_Jones_Complaint.pdf) & [excerpts](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2c2i3f/caligirl_criminal_complaint_excerpts/), [PACER](/docs/sr/2014-07-29-pacer-caligirl.maff)), pled guilty, and was [sentenced to 5 years & ten months](http://www.justice.gov/usao/flm/press/2014/Dec/20141218_Jones.html "Texas Business Executive Sentenced To Prison For Illegally Selling Oxycodone On Silk Road").
An undercover agent had made 2 purchases through SR1 and 6 over Bitmessage after the SR1 bust; CALIGIRL did not vary packaging methods or drop off location, allowing his packages to be profiled, traced back to a sorting facility, where the agent discovered they were all dropped off at a single postal box.
In addition, on the last purchase, the agent social-engineered CALIGIRL into accepting part of the payment to his personal bank account.
This all fed into a comprehensive investigation of CALIGIRL's life which drew on information from (but likely not exclusive to):
Facebook; Amazon shopping logs and IP; `#bitcoin-otc` IP & transactions; Local Bitcoin transactions; domain names and telephone; cellphone apps (Ding) usage & callers & IPs; Post Office photos (from automated postal machine); the landlord for his post box; travel records; electronic toll records recording movements of his car; hotels he stayed at (he used places he stayed or was near as return addresses); and financial records from: Xoom (and IP addresses), Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Western Union, & MoneyGram.
There are currently no known controlled deliveries or arrests of CALIGIRL customers (possibly the SR1 bust eliminated most of his business).

On 5 November 2014, Marylanders Tom & Amanda Callahan (SR1 Bitcoin seller/exchanger ["JumboMonkeyBiscuit"](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/75803901ae.htm)) were raided by the Baltimore task force (see [exhibit B of _Bridges_](http://antilop.cc/sr/files/2016_06_30_BRIDGES_Emergency_motion_exhibit_B.pdf), and ["United States v. 50.44 Bitcoins"](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-5044-bitcoins)) for money laundering.
The SR1 server image had been used to identify a PO box that JumboMonkeyBiscuit used for their Bitcoin-for-mailed-cash sales, registered in their name, which in conjunction with an October 2014 intercept by USPS of \$10000 cash (they apparently had moved on to other DNMs but it is unspecified which).
Their case came to light as part of the investigation of dirty cop Shaun Bridges, who stole some of the seized bitcoins.

On 28 May 2015, charges were announced against 30yo Louisiana man Beau Wattigney for being the SR1/2 "PurpleLotus" seller of counterfeit coupons ([complaint](/docs/sr/sr2-purplelotus-complaint.pdf); [press release](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-orleans-man-charged-conspiracy-commit-wire-fraud-and-conspiracy-commit-trademark "New Orleans Man Charged With Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Trademark Counterfeiting Using the 'Silk Road'1 Online Marketplace"); [media](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/inside-a-million-dollar-dark-web-coupon-counterfeiting-scheme/ "Inside a Giant Dark-Web Scheme to Sell Counterfeit Coupons")); he [pled guilty](https://www.fbi.gov/philadelphia/press-releases/2015/leader-of-coupon-counterfeiting-ring-on-silk-road-websites-pleads-guilty " Leader of Coupon Counterfeiting Ring on Silk Road Websites Pleads Guilty") and was [sentenced January 2016 to 3.4 years prison](http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/new-orleans-man-sentenced-41-months-manufacturing-and-selling-more-1-million-counterfeit "New Orleans Man Sentenced to 41 Months for Manufacturing and Selling More Than $1 Million in Counterfeit Coupons on Silk Road").
PurpleLotus had retired well before May 2015; the complaint says only that he was caught in part based on "forensic analysis of images of servers seized during the dismantlement of Silk Road 1.0, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') was able to recover, among other things, transaction histories and private message communications associated with Silk Road 1.0 users." and also quotes a (unencrypted) PM from PurpleLotus to a buyer explaining how to use counterfeit coupons.
A Redditor claiming to be [SR1 seller RXMan](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/6b5ed4c1fc.htm) [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/37n0lr/purple_lotus_arrested/cro763z) that he remembers trading prescription pills for coupons and that PurpleLotus provided, via unencrypted PMs, the name Beau Wattigney & a mailing address.

## Silk Road 2 (SR2)
### Australia

On 26 September 2014, the 21yo South Australia man Ryan James Norman was arrested while picking up a package from the post office after [Customs intercepted a shipment](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/man-arrested-after-220000-worth-of-wizard-drug-25inbome-intercepted/story-fni6uo1m-1227075205971 "Man arrested after $220,000 worth of 'wizard' drug 25i-NBOMe intercepted") of ~5000 doses of 25i-NBOMe from Canada; he was sentenced in September 2015 to [3.5 years](http://www.courts.sa.gov.au/SentencingRemarks/Pages/lightbox.aspx?IsDlg=1&Filter=4029).
It later emerged that he was [a seller on SR2](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-12/drug-trafficking-on-silk-road-site-shut-down-by-fbi/6541596 "'Naive' drug trafficker used own name on website now shut down by FBI, Adelaide court hears"); I have [identified Norman as the SR2 seller "MagicAU"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/39m4sc/sr2_arrest_australian_seller_magicauryan_james/) based on similar products and MagicAU vanishing from SR2 during 26-28 September 2014, immediately after Norman was raided, and MagicAU's relatively young vendor age which matches the description of Norman as having sold for ~2 months before being arrested.

### Germany

During April 2015, a 40yo German man in Würzburg [was arrested](https://www.polizei.bayern.de/news/presse/aktuell/index.html/222614 "Rauschgift im Internet bestellt - 40-Jähriger in Untersuchungshaft") for purchases of MDMA, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis & "synthetic" drugs totaling kilograms [off of SR2](http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.kiloweise-amphetamin-hunderte-pillen-drogen-im-internet-bestellt-wuerzburger-dealer-40-festgenommen.410ac42d-06ad-490e-a5ec-05539d8ea4d8.html "Drogen im Internet bestellt - Würzburger Dealer (40) festgenommen") (he does not seem to have been a SR2 seller, indicating he was a local reseller) and earlier markets starting in 2012.
The investigation appears to have relied FBI forensic analysis of the seized SR2 server's PMs (he, like many, apparently had not been using PGP in communicating with his sellers) and also German customs intercepts of several orders.

### Indonesia

In late January 2014, a [Canadian man T.S. & Indonesian woman L.A.](http://news.detik.com/read/2014/01/22/133657/2474783/10/ "Selundupkan Ekstasi, Guru Bule dan Kekasihnya Ditangkap") [were arrested](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2u26ij/uncategorized_i_bought_100_superman_pills_from/) after a package of MDMA (100 Superman pills) from the Netherlands (which she had ordered from "pillbay" on Silk Road 2) was intercepted by customs & his West Jakarta residence searched; they were sentenced to 10 & 5 years respectively.

### Ireland

On 5 November 2014, as part of Operation Onymous, 2 men (Neil Mannion & Richard O'Connor) were arrested in Dublin, Ireland, uncovering drugs (MDMA/LSD/marijuana)/Bitcoins/address-lists; the Irish investigation began after information was received from a foreign agency.
They were probably the seller "TheHulkster", based on volume, location, & drugs.
(Media coverage: [1](http://www.garda.ie/Controller.aspx?Page=14304 "As a result of an international drug trafficking investigation into the sale and supply of controlled drugs on an encrypted layer of the internet known as the Darknet an Irish vendor was identified in recent weeks.

### New Zealand (NZ)

December 2014 saw the SR2 buyer Andrew Graham Hodgson sentenced for importing methamphetamine, marijuana & NBOMe; his mail had been intercepted from July to September 2014 ([1](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/63743171/five-arrests-in-500k-meth-sting "Five arrests in $500k meth sting"), [2](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/63857494/silk-road-leads-to-home-detention "Silk Road leads to home detention")) and he was arrested that September.

[Daniel Patrick McKechnie, Taine Mita Piriru Edwards, & Mitchell Charles Connor-Dagg](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/332105/trio-serious-drug-charges "Trio on serious drug charges") (aged 18-20) were arrested & charged in February 2015 after customs interceptions with importing, from November 2014-January 2015, LSD/MDMA/methamphetamine which ["had all been sourced through the internet from the United States and Europe in a sophisticated operation"](http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/police-bust-dunedin-drug-ring-2015020423 "Police bust Dunedin drug ring ") for local resale.
They had been ordering ["via the Silk Road site"](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/70101651/dunedin-student-jailed-for-dark-web-drug-imports "Dunedin student jailed for dark web drug imports"), presumably SR2, although what market they were using (after SR2 closed) from late November 2014 - January 2015 is unspecified.

### United Kingdom (UK)

During the 5 November 2014 busted of SR2, the [authorities announced](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/news-listings/483-international-law-enforcement-deals-major-blow-to-dark-web-markets "International law enforcement deals major blow to dark web markets") [6 UK arrests](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/six-britons-arrested-silk-road-dark-web-takedown-online-drugs), but no details have emerged since besides the basic description given to the press (were any of them [Budworx or Top\_Gear\_UK](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2lkpaz/6_vendors_arrested_in_uk/)?):

> The NCA described the six British arrests as "significant", adding that a large amount of computer equipment has been seized at all the addresses searched and will now be forensically examined. The six - a 20-year-old man from Liverpool, a 19-year-old man from New Waltham in Lincolnshire, a 30-year-old man from Cleethorpes [Lincolnshire], a 29-year-old man from Aberdovey in Wales and a man and woman, both 58, also from Aberdovey, have all been bailed after being interviewed.

The "19-year-old man from New Waltham" turns out to be Alex Middleton ("MaximusDecimus" on SR2), who sold [methoxetamine](!Wikipedia)/MXE & Xanax & [4-MEC](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/surprise-now-illegal-legal-highs-are-widely-available-on-the-dark-web) [internationally](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/716-dark-web-drug-dealer-selling-super-strength-ketamine-jailed "Dark web drug dealer selling super strength ketamine substitute jailed"); he pled guilty in June 2015 and was sentenced to [2 years 4 months in September 2015](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/dark-web-drug-dealer-jailed-6546740 "Dark web drug dealer jailed for selling horse tranquiliser drug ketamine disguised as health food").

In February 2015, [charges were announced for 5 people](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/silk-road-fallout-5-more-charged-in-the-uk-with-deep-web-crimes "Silk Road Fallout: 5 More Charged in the UK with Deep Web Crimes"):

>  A 29-year-old man from the UK was also charged today, a National Crime Agency spokesperson told me. His 11 charges include the possession of four stun guns which were disguised as other weapons; conspiring with Peter Ward to supply a quantity of cannabis; and another charge of the importation of cocaine. Another three people were charged with drug offenses. They are 29-year-old Cei William Owens, charged with supplying Class A and B drugs; and 59-year-old Robin Clinton Bradshaw and 58-year-old Elynedd Ann Owens, each charged with possession of Class A and B drugs. They are all residents of the Aberdovey area of Wales.

One of the 5 was PlutoPete, whose case was already known; the second person is some sort of connection to PlutoPete and is a new case; and the last 3 were noted to line up with the mentioned ages & locations of 3 of the original 6, apparently indicating that one was a seller and the other two were a buyer.
Cei Owens ("Johnny Alpha") [pled guilty](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/silk-road-20-drug-dealer-9507820 "Silk Road 2.0 drug dealer facing jail after being caught hours after FBI 'dark net' swoop") & was sentenced to [two years](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/659-aberdovey-man-sentenced-to-two-years-for-444-dark-web-drug-deals "Aberdovey man sentenced to two years for 444 dark web drug deals") for sales/possession of "cannabis resin, herbal cannabis, MDMA and psilocybin".
Of the original 6, this seems to leave 3 unaccounted: the 20-yo-Liverpool, and the 30-yo-Cleethorpes.

21yo Leeds man Luke Fairless was [arrested 10 October 2014 after a search](http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/crime/university-student-in-leeds-exposed-as-drug-dealer-after-postal-blunder-1-7803327 "University student in Leeds exposed as drug dealer after postal blunder: A former university student who was dealing drugs in Leeds ordered 100 ecstasy tablets from a website but was arrested after they were delivered to the wrong address") of his house was triggered by a MDMA order being delivered to the wrong address and the occupant complaining; the search turned up MDMA, LSD, diazepam, DMT, & mescaline, and he was sentenced in 2016 for importing.

### USA

In early May 2014, the SR2 seller ["Xanax King" (Jeremy Donagal) & his associates](http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_25861423/contra-costa-nine-charged-massive-xanax-drug-operation) [were arrested](http://patch.com/california/martinez/xanax-king-of-martinez-among-9-charged-with-making-counterfeit-drugs-laundering-money "'Xanax King' Of Martinez Among 9 Charged With Making Counterfeit Drugs, Laundering Money: Nine people were indicted by a federal grand jury in Oakland on charges of manufacturing counterfeit prescription drugs, money laundering or both.") ([DEA press release](http://www.justice.gov/dea/divisions/sf/2014/sf053014.shtml)); he ran a very large operation with multiple employees, purchased ingredients using Western Union & wire transfers to China, "sold drugs locally, distributing Xanax tablets, GHB, and steroids", some sort of clearnet website ([`xkloves.us`](http://www.xkloves.us), content removed in lieu of a now-defunct Tor hidden service), and had at least one "confidential informant" in his organization (see the [anti-bail letter](/docs/sr/2014-06-25-xanaxking-antibailletter-cand035011914356.pdf)), who was handling their SR2 orders at the end according to a [media report](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/9418693-171/feds-use-facebook-to-id "Feds use Facebook to ID man tied to Xanax conspiracy: Authorities say man rammed DEA vehicle after getting package") (some buyers reported being [asked to resend](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/26w0qe/busted_xanaxking/chv2yw0) their PGP-encrypted addresses).

The fall out from XK's bust has been substantial: the anti-bail letter claims "In addition to the nine defendants in this case, evidence gathered from Defendant's enterprise led to the arrest of nearly 60 other people throughout the country".
Several of his customers received controlled deliveries and have been arrested as well.
2 controlled deliveries on 28 May picked up [4 men in Bloomington, Indiana](http://www.wbiw.com/local/archive/2014/05/police-recover-approximately-15000.php "Police Recover Approximately 15,000 Xanax Pills") (Carlos Matthew Allen, David Christian Feigel, Paul Furto, & Andrew C. Dickey).
[Kory D. Kreider in New Orleans, Louisiana](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/9418693-171/feds-use-facebook-to-id "Feds use Facebook to ID man tied to Xanax conspiracy: Authorities say man rammed DEA vehicle after getting package") whose pickup of a package was surveilled managed to evade arrest on 29 May but was arrested a few days later using cellphone records & Facebook data.
Some other CDs in late May/early June 2014 are highly likely to be XK-related.
In Naperville, Illinois, [Brian Patrick Noone was arrested on 30 May 2014](http://ilinnews.com/naperville-man-arrested-after-police-find-600-xanax-pills/ "Naperville man arrested after police find 600 Xanax pills") after a search warrant yielded 600 Xanax pills, apparently based on "a tip from a federal task force about drug trafficking in Naperville".
<!-- TODO: followup: Brian Patrick Noone not in PACER; charged in Will County; requested an affidavit through https://www.i2file.net/ -->
In Nashville, Tennessee, 3 people (Demarcus Blue, Markuite Matthews, & Adrevious Rayner) [were arrested after a CD on 29 May 2014](http://www.wsmv.com/story/25667210/metro-police-seize "Metro police seize 21,000 Xanax pills") of [5000 gel cap Xanax pills](http://wsmv.images.worldnow.com/images/25667210_BG4.jpg) sent by a "An alleged drug ring" shipping from California and the mailer ["was taken into custody at the end of last week"](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2014/06/01/xanax-pills-seized-hermitage/9847299/ "5,000 Xanax pills seized in Hermitage").

On 5 November 2014, as the final piece of Operation Onymous, the operator of Silk Road 2, Blake Benthall / "Defcon" was arrested in San Francisco ([press release](http://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2014/operator-of-silk-road-2.0-website-charged-in-manhattan-federal-court); [complaint](/docs/sr/sr2-blakebenthall-complaint.pdf)).
It is highly likely that the undercover agent Cirrus had enabled the locating of the SR2 server, which Benthall apparently had rented  under his own name (possibly at his employer Close's hosting), after which his Bitcoin spending (on a Tesla) was noted and surveillance correlated Defcon's activities with Benthall's; after being arrested, he ["did admit to everything"](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/11/prosecutor-silk-road-2-0-suspect-did-admit-to-everything/).

On 6 November 2014, David & Teri Schell were [arrested in California](http://www.actionnewsnow.com/news/durham-couple-indicted-as-part-of-silk-road-2-0-crackdown/ "Durham couple indicted as part of Silk Road 2.0 crackdown") for selling marijuana and marijuana wax ([complaint](/docs/sr/2014-11-20-californiacanbis.pdf), [PACER](/docs/sr/2014-11-20-blackmarkets-schell.maff)); [additional coverage](http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/NorCal-couple-ensnared-in-dark-Web-drug-site-5907946.php "Butte County couple ensnared in Silk Road 2.0 drug case") indicated they were investigated after "discovering an Internet Protocol address was accessing the Silk Road 2.0 site" and then PO box surveillance nailed them.
The DoctorClu case reveals that the seller portal for SR2 had been used to de-anonymize a few IPs (but not many), implying that an undercover agent (presumably Cirrus) had inserted a de-anonymization exploit similar to the previous Freedom Hosting exploit.
They were probably the SR1 & SR2 seller "CaliforniaCanibas" ([profile](http://antilop.cc/sr/vendors/7058d46a86.htm)).

In "last fall" (Fall 2014), US Air Force cadet Nathaniel Penalosa's dorm room was searched and a military investigation into his sale of drugs to fellow students at the USAF academy, including [LSD, molly/methylenedioxy-methamphetamine,](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/colorado-springs-area/air-force-academy-cadet-3rd-class-nathaniel-penalosa-accused-of-using-and-distributing-drugs-on-base) and [modafinil](/Modafinil#legal-risk).
He had ordered them via mail from [Silk Road 2](http://gazette.com/air-force-academy-cadet-sentenced-for-dealing-drugs/article/1562468 "Air Force Academy cadet sentenced for dealing drugs")
His court-martial [began around August 2015](http://gazette.com/witnesses-cadet-got-drugs-from-online-black-market-and-sold-them-in-dorms/article/1557552), leading to the expulsion of 3 other cadets, and he accepted a plea-bargain for 3 years.

In November 2014, 37yo Louisiana man Michael Munro Jr. was [arrested](http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2016/03/11/lafayette-man-pleads-guilty-drug-smuggling-online/81663648/ "Lafayette man pleads guilty to drug smuggling online") for [importing Xanax & oxycodone](http://www.katc.com/story/31449985/lafayette-man-pleads-guilty-to-drug-charges "Lafayette man pleads guilty to drug charges") bought on SR2 since March 2014, and [sentenced to 1.6 years](http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/crime/2016/08/30/lafayette-man-sentenced-18-months-prison-shipping-drugs-via-silk-road/89604606/ "Lafayette man sentenced to 18 months in prison for shipping drugs via Silk Road").

The Washington man Brian Farrell & SR2 staffer "DoctorClu" was [arrested 20 January 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419092155/http://koin.com/ap/alleged-manager-of-silk-road-2-0-website-arrested/ "Alleged manager of Silk Road 2.0 website arrested"); his IP had been uncovered in July 2014 accessing the SR2 seller portal[^DoctorClu-IP], like CaliforniaCanibas, by [CMU researchers and the information turned over to the FBI](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/court-docs-show-a-university-helped-fbi-bust-silk-road-2-child-porn-suspects "Court Docs Show a University Helped FBI Bust Silk Road 2, Child Porn Suspects").
The [local police investigated](http://www.bellevuereporter.com/news/288854101.html "Bellevue man under investigation for online drug dealing") by post-office checks and then interviewing him & his roommate on 22 December 2014; the roommate spoke freely about Farrell's drug use and online connections and the next day even provided some of Farrell's drugs to the police, allowing [a search warrant](/docs/sr/2015-01-07-kingcountysuperiorcourt-brianfarrell-searchwarrantaffidavit.pdf) to search the house and uncover Farrell's prescription drugs on 2 January 2015, at which point he confessed everything & to helping run SR2 as the employee DoctorClu and was then arrested (the charges being upgraded from local pill charges to [federal conspiracy charges](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2918824/U-S-charges-man-says-linked-Silk-Road-successor-site-drug-scheme.html); [complaint](/docs/sr/brianfarrell-federalcomplaint.pdf)).
He was sentenced to [8 years in June 2016](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2852008/Farrell-Sentence.pdf).

[^DoctorClu-IP]: From the search warrant:

    > ...From January 2014 to July 2014, a FBI NY Source of Information (SOI) provided reliable IP addresses for TOR and hidden services such as SR2, which included its main marketplace URL (`silkroad6ownfk.onion`), its vendor URL (`vx3w763ohd256iyh.onion`), its forum URL (`silkroad5v7dywlc.onion`) and its support interface (`uz434sei7arqunp6.onion`). The SOI's information ultimately led to the identification of SR2 servers, which led to the identification of at least seventeen black markets on TOR.
    >
    > The SOI also identified approximately 78 IP addresses that accessed a vendor .onion address. A user cannot accidentally end up on the vendor site. The site is for vendors only, and access is only given to the site by the SR2 administrators/moderators after confirmation of a significant number of successful transactions. If a user visits the vendor URL, he or she is asked for a user name and password. Without a user name and password, the vendor web site cannot be viewed.
    >
    > Current Investigation
    >
    > On July 30, 2014, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Seattle received information that a user associated with IP address 67.182.142.24 accessed the vendor portal of SR2. Records reveal the IP address was associated with a Comcast internet account registered to Steve Phelps at 4238 163rd Avenue SE - Bellevue, WA 98006. On August 8, 2014, the Washington Department of Licensing reported the following vehicle and driver information for that address:... On August 13, 2014, Homeland Security Investigations initiated surveillance activities on the above address, further observing the blue Volkswagen Beetle, and the white Chevrolet Camero...On October 10, 2014, Homeland Security investigations, assisted by a U.S. Postal Inspector, visited several U.S. Post Offices near 4238 163rd Avenue SE, Bellevue, WA 98006...Another employee at the same location recognized the photograph of Steve Phelps, further stating he may have dropped off a tub of letters for mailing and he drove a blue station wagon... [and so on through to pg9, then the rest seems to be search warrant boilerplate]

Michigan psychedelics buyer Michael Carlton Paiva was arrested in 2016 due to being identified in Operation Onymous as a SR2 buyer for MDMA/25i-NBOMe/DOM/DMT/LSD/Al-LAD/mescaline/"liquid mushrooms" and was [sentenced to 30 months](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/2017_0309_Paiva "Norton Shores 'Dark Web' Drug Dealer Sentenced To 30 Months In Prison") on 9 March 2017.
Given the involvement of SR2, being a buyer, and the long delay, he may represent another arrest due to unencrypted PMs.

## Topix2

On 2 November 2015, 26yo Scottish man David Trail was arrested as part of Operation Onymous and pled guilty in mid-2016 ([1](/docs/sr/2016-06-02-heraldscotland-topix2.mht "Scots 'Sheldon Cooper' admits dealing drugs for bitcoin after FBI sting; http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/homenews/14519842.Scots__Sheldon_Cooper__admits_dealing_drugs_for_bitcoin_after_FBI_sting/"), [2](http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/crime/fbi-helps-catch-edinburgh-man-selling-drugs-on-dark-web-1-4139454  "FBI helps catch Edinburgh man selling drugs on 'dark web'")). He may represent one of the missing UK arrests.
According to the newspaper to coverage, "The initial investigation in to Trail began in August 2014 when the FBI handed over a range of IP addresses linked to a whole range of dark web sites", and "His biggest slip-up was that, financially, he didn't know how to cover his tracks."
Someone claiming to be Trail on Reddit [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/4lgh8d/scots_sheldon_cooper_admits_dealing_drugs_for/d3nvhz2):

> The FBI cracked Tor and traced the German server back to me. There was encryption in place but they caught me with it all unlocked unfortunately. When you're not expecting a police raid by the FBI (was a very small scale website, 10s of users) you don't set up plausible denialability based encryption and automatic shutdown on your door being busted down.

### Australia

A Canberra, ACT teen was given [a suspended 4-year sentence in November 2015](http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-teen-imported-tensofthousands-of-dollars-in-drugs-he-bought-online-20151102-gkoifx.html "Canberra teen imported tens-of-thousands of dollars in drugs he bought online") over his local resale of marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, & LSD bought off an unspecified DNM using Bitcoin; his first package was detected by Customs in September 2014, as were 6 packages after that, leading to a raid in May 2015.

### Belgium

In February 2015, two Belgian men from Genk & Maaseik [were arrested](http://www.hln.be/regio/nieuws-uit-genk/man-verkocht-internationaal-drugs-via-internet-a2498379/ "Man verkocht internationaal drugs via internet") for sales internationally of methamphetamine/amphetamines/MDMA, possibly due to the fake stamps they were using to save money (similar to the earlier German RedBull case).
The first was sentenced to 2 years prison, the second to 0.5 years probation.

In October 2016, a 25yo Belgium man and three accomplices [were arrested](https://web.archive.org/web/20161027134259/http://kw.knack.be/west-vlaanderen/nieuws/criminaliteit/twintiger-uit-torhout-dealde-wereldwijd-synthetische-drugs-via-de-onderwereld-van-het-internet/article-normal-239819.html) ([DeepDotWeb article](https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/11/04/belgian-amphetamine-vendor-arrested-due-to-insufficient-postage-on-his-packages/)) for selling amphetamines under the online vendor name Evilution. The vendor used a local computer shop as a return address and six packages got returned to that address because of insufficient postage. Since the shop owner reported the returned packages to law enforcement, an investigation started. Fingerprints found on the examined packages belonged to Stijn Victor, who has been arrested previously for drug crimes. He mainly sold synthetic drugs and amphetamines, amounting to a total of 1878 transactions. During the arrest, law enforcement also seized 4000 bitcoins. Victor’s lawyer claims that parts of it came from legal programming jobs that his client did years ago as well as additional Bitcoin trading not linked to his vending activities.

### Cyprus

In December 2014, 3 men in Northern Cyprus/TRNC [were](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2pvoqc/i_got_caught_life_is_in_ruins_dont_be_stupid_in/) [arrested](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/2pzrs1/my_life_is_ruined_because_i_have_imported_22/) while trying to pick up a package of marijuana sent from Canada (in a CD, although no signatures were involved).

### Germany

In November 2015, it was announced that [9 men 19-24yo from Forcheim, Bamberg and Herzogenaurach](http://www.infranken.de/regional/forchheim/Im-Darknet-mit-Drogen-gehandelt-Kripo-entlarvt-neun-Maenner-aus-Franken;art216,1355609 "Im "Darknet" mit Drogen gehandelt: Kripo entlarvt neun Männer aus Franken; Insgesamt neun jungen Männern aus Forchheim, Bamberg und Herzogenaurach kam jetzt die Kripo Bamberg auf die Spur. Über das Internet handelten die Männer in großem Stil mit verschiedenen Betäubungsmitteln") had cumulatively been arrested who had made ~70 purchases of marijuana, MDMA, LSD, amphetamine from the DNMs for local resale; the case probably began when the first was arrested and flipped.

In July 2016, [3 German men were charged](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/07/05/germany-3-charged-for-illegally-making-selling-firearms.html "Germany: 3 charged for illegally making, selling firearms") with converting/modifying/selling guns "on Darknet sites", selling pistols & rifles.
These conversions may be connected to the [2016 Munich shooting](!Wikipedia) by 18yo Ali Sonboly, the Glock handgun for which [is reportedly](http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/amokschuetze-von-muenchen-tatwaffe-aus-dem-darknet-a-1104461.html "Amokschütze plante die Tat seit einem Jahr: Der 18-jährige David S., der in München neun Menschen erschoss, hatte die Tat ein Jahr lang vorbereitet. Laut Ermittlern soll er dazu ein eigenes Manifest geschrieben haben.") a 'reactivated theater weapon' (for which the firing pin had been removed or receiver cut?) which Bitmessage chatlogs indicate had been purchased over the ['darknet'](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-cyber-idUSKCN1071KW "After mass shooting, German police focus on "dark net" crime") in some fashion; however, chatlogs are not usually employed in purchasing off a DNM like AlphaBay, and [later coverage](http://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-arrests-suspected-gun-dealer-in-munich-rampage-case-1471372591 "Germany Arrests Suspected Gun Dealer in Munich Rampage Case: Man accused of selling gun to teenager who killed nine people in shooting spree last month")  indicates a different 31yo man had met Sonboly in person for the gun & ammo sales.

A 41yo Berlin man was [sentenced to 4 years in September 2016](http://www.bz-berlin.de/tatort/menschen-vor-gericht/berliner-darknet-dealer-muss-vier-jahre-ins-gefaengnis "Berliner Darknet-Dealer muss vier Jahre ins Gefängnis") for selling handguns & ammunition; a misdelivered package was intercepted, apparently prompting some undercover purchases backtraced to him, followed up by bugging/surveillance.
It's unspecified if he was one of the 3 charged in July 2016 or if he operated on a DNM.

### India

2 men were arrested as part of a Bitcoin carding ring in [July 2016](http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/financial-fraud-punjab-cops-brush-with-darknet-bitcoins/story-w4YDmUJFDgkV12scPzWWxO.html "Financial fraud: Punjab cops' brush with Darknet, Bitcoins").

### Israel

An [Israeli man Weitzman](http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4611084,00.html "חשד: הזמין שוקולד עם קוקאין ברשת האפלה :צעיר מכפר סבא חשוד שהזמין קוקאין דרך ה'דארקנט', והסם הגיע ארצה בתוך פרלינים. קו ההגנה שלו: 'בכלל הזמנתי סמי הזיה שאינם אסורים בחוק'") was arrested ~4 January 2015 after a "darknet" package containing cocaine was detected by a sniffer dog at Customs.

An Israeli teen [was arrested ~12 January 2015](http://news.walla.co.il/item/2819632 "חשד: רכש סמים ב'ביטקוין'ומכר אותם בתיכון באשדוד: חבילה שעוררה את חשדם של הבודקים בנתב'ג הכילה מאות גרמים של מריחואנה - והובילה לבן 18 שקיבל יותר מ-10 חבילות של סמים שונים. החשוד למד בשיטוט באינטרנט כיצד לרכוש סמים ברשת 'דארקנט' המוצפנת") ([translation](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2015/01/14/israeli-teen-arrested/)) after a package of marijuana was intercepted by Customs at Ben Gurion Airport; the media coverage specifies he had bought that package & 13 others off the DNMs, but not which one or the seller.

### Netherlands

On 6 February 2015, a [man](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2015/februari/6/10-virtuele-dealer-in-echte-wereld-aangehouden.html "Virtuele dealer in echte wereld aangehouden: Kerkrade - De politie hield vrijdag 6 februari een 41-jarige man uit Kerkrade aan op verdenking van handel in drugs op het zogeheten dark web.") was arrested in Kerkrade for selling drugs on "the so-called dark Web", and the search seized drugs & bitcoins.

On 3 March 2015, [2 men & 1 woman were arrested and searched](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2015/maart/9/01-onderzoek-naar-verzilveren-440.000-euro-aan-bitcoins.html "Onderzoek naar verzilveren 440.000 euro aan bitcoins: Sneek - De politie heeft afgelopen week drie personen aangehouden in een onderzoek naar hennepteelt en het verzilveren van bitcoins. Er is een hennepkwekerij opgerold en er zijn twee wapens in beslag genomen."), uncovering a marijuana grow operation; they been selling bitcoins for a total of €440,000 (a sum too large to be explained as anything other than DNM sales).

### New Zealand (NZ)

A NZer was arrested [in April 2013](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10879570 "Teen arrested for importing, ordering drugs online") over multiple very large orders from an online site, which may or may not have been SR1.

An [11 December 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131216055744/http://www.police.govt.nz/news/updates/31590-0) NZ police press release reported the arrest of 3 Wellington men for "small quantities of LSD, Methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), Class C analogue powders and the psychoactive substance NBOMe" which had been "ordered from on line suppliers such as 'The Silk Road'"; no further details are available.

A 21 June 2014 [_Dominion Post_](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/10185845/People-next-door-buying-drugs-online "'People next door' buying drugs online") article says that " A series of drug raids in a police operation spanning Porirua, Tawa, the Kapiti Coast and Hutt Valley and central Wellington resulted in 21 arrests over the past week [15-20 June 2014]. Six of those arrested now face serious charges related to the alleged importation of drugs bought online from websites similar to Silk Road." (This is a revised figure from the [earlier article on "Operation Python"](http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10177294/Police-bust-drugs-ring-find-stolen-carving "Police bust drugs ring, find stolen carving") which had mentioned that "Six Kapiti houses were raided and five arrests made as part of a large police sting targeting internet drug importers.")
I currently do not know the specifics of those 6 arrests or have any NZ cases in that date range.

On 11 August 2014, the 22yo [polytechnic college student](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/312318/dunedin-ecstasy-lsd-haul "Student charged over party drug haul") [Nicholas Peter Heatley](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10476533/Jury-trial-for-accused-drug-smuggler "Jury trial for accused drug smuggler ") was arrested for importing [LSD/MDMA/Ritalin/marijuana](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/10476533/Jury-trial-for-accused-drug-smuggler "Jury trial for accused drug smuggler") for resale locally after customs interceptions January - August 2014, sourced "from Germany and the United Kingdom via the internet" (clarified in later coverage to have been the "Dark Web" and so presumably one of the markets).
(He was sentenced [in December 2014](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/326676/student-drug-dealer-jailed "Student drug dealer jailed") to [4.5 years prison](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/65784334/Three-men-arrested-over-drug-importation-to-Dunedin).)

[Customs reports in May 2015](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/344090/drug-dealing-dark-web "Drug dealing on 'Dark Web'") that

> In 2014, Customs intercepted more than 1300 class A and B drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act; a rise of more than 25% from 2013. While no drugs were intercepted in Dunedin in 2013, last year cocaine, MDMA, LSD and methamphetamine were all intercepted in the city. By the end of April this year Customs had carried out more than 400 interceptions nationally, and found ephedrine (which can be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine) and methamphetamine in Dunedin..."We know with one job they brought in \$50,000 dollars worth - that's one import."

[2 23yo NZ Dunedin university students](http://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/363444/students-arrested-raids "Students arrested in raids") were raided on 16 November 2015 after customs intercepts, uncovering cocaine, MDMA, LSD, & "prescription drugs" which they resold locally; likely DNM related because one police officer quoted warns "students using the Internet to import drugs".

On 9 June 2015, the arrest in the "previous days" of 4 men aged 29-31 from "Oslo and Skien"  was announced by Norwegian police (media:

They apparently had been selling marijuana and unspecified other products on the Dark Web for bitcoins, apparently internationally as well as in Norway; which markets, which sellers, and details on how they were caught were not provided.
[2017 coverage](https://www.rt.com/news/380208-drug-dealers-norway-bitcoin/ "Suspected drug dealers should repay profits in bitcoins – Norwegian prosecutors") of 3 men arrested in Oslo in June 2015 says they sold marijuana on SR1 and other sites, and depended on foreign police assistance (based on seller records/PMs from the SR1 server image?).

### Scotland

In March 2016, former banker & 28yo man Aditya Rajiv was convicted of selling two men's financial information on the dark web to a "covert internet investigator" who informed police ([1](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen/865699/top-banker-cleared-of-defrauding-pensioners-but-fined-for-selling-details-on-dark-web/ "Top Aberdeen banker cleared of defrauding pensioners but fined for selling personal details on 'dark web'")); he had also been accused (previously?) of using Paypal to defraud 4 customers in mid-2013 ([1](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen/826260/aberdeen-banker-on-trial-accused-of-swindling-thousands-out-of-north-east-pensioners/ "Aberdeen banker accused of swindling north-east grandparents out of thousands of pounds")).

### Scandinavia

On the Bungee54 forums, a customer service representative [said on 2014-10-20](/docs/sr/bungee54-forums-20141105-4162-deliverytimes.html "Bungee54 Member Assembly → Shipping → Delivery times: (Page 6 of 7); http://bungee54ft2us2fs.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=4162") "Within the last 4 month there were 2 buyers that reported incidents with feds - none of both within the last 10 weeks. 1 was in a Scandinavian country and resulted in a fine for the client...None of both orders were above 25g".
Which country or when this MDMA buyer was arrested & fined is unclear.

### Sweden

[Swedish police](http://snpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SNPF_1-15.pdf "Svenska Narkotika: POLISFÖRENINGENS TIDSKRIFT Nr 1/2015: Många som säljer droger på darknet åker faktiskt fast... Darknet är den mörka och anonyma del av internet som kan nås via inloggning på TOR-nätverket. Här säljs bland annat narkotika och andra droger. Från att ha varit närmast osårbart, är myndigheternas möjligheter nu mycket större att komma åt den illegala handeln på darknet.") (pg19) claimed in February 2015:  "Swedish police work actively at identifying vendors. A large chunk of the Swedes who sell drugs on DNMs have been caught, and nearly half of the known nicknames believed to be Swedish have been caught, either by local drug police or by cyberpolice.".
It's unclear what they consider "known nicknames" and no specific numbers are mentioned, but it could indicate that more Swedish sellers have been arrested than are publicly known.

[A 22 May 2015 police article](https://polisen.se/Aktuellt/Nyheter/2015/Maj/Atal-mot-forsaljare-av-narkotika-pa-natet--/ "Åtal mot försäljare av narkotika på nätet: Allt fler säljare av narkotika på internet identifieras och döms, Sverige ligger långt före andra länder i Europa gällande lagföring av brottet. Idag åtalas en av de största svenska säljarna, och den här brottsligheten ska bli mer prioriterad av polisen") is more specific: "Swedish police has identified 12 of the 20 biggest Swedish vendors on Silk Road (out of 100). 8 of them has already been charged."
4 Swedish sellers are currently known to have been arrested: Speedsweden, SweExpress, Livefromsweden, Alexandrus. That leaves 4 missing.

### UK

In "August/September 2014", 22yo Cheltenham man Jordan Richards-Chiverton's ("Luigi") order of 13.5g of cocaine from a DNM seller in Costa Rica was intercepted at a postal handling center, and he was CDed at the post office; he likely resold locally, and [was sentenced to 2 years](http://www.gloucestershireecho.co.uk/Cheltenham-student-jailed-importing-cocaine-Costa/story-28599085-detail/story.html "Cheltenham student imported cocaine from Costa Rica using dark web, Bitcoin and the name Luigi").

On 14 April 2015, the UK's National Crime Agency's Twitter account [announced](https://twitter.com/NCA_UK/statuses/587991263502331905) [that](https://twitter.com/NCA_UK/status/588624765193035776):

> Our campaign against #DarkWeb criminality continues - 5 men in their 20s charged with drug offences on dark web forums...Manchester men face over 40 charges of supplying drugs globally via #DarkWeb forums

_Vice_ journalist [Joseph Cox](http://motherboard.vice.com/author/JosephCox) asked the NCA for more details; this is all they would tell him:

> charged with a range of offences relating to possessing and supplying controlled drugs.
>
> - Basil ASSAF (born 1991) - Bombay House, Whitworth St, Manchester
> - Jamie RODEN (born 1992) - Half Moon Lane, East London
> - Elliot HYAMS (born 1992) - Copperkins Lane, Amersham
> - Jaikishen PATEL (born 1992) - Woodford Ave, Ilford
> - Joshua MORGAN (born 1989) - Chapeltown St, Manchester
>
> All are due before Manchester City Magistrates on 14/05/15

It's unclear if they were Silk Road related or not - 3 of them *may* be the still-unidentified 3 Manchester sellers arrested simultaneous with the Silk Road 1 raid in October 2013, and then the other 2 are unrelated or perhaps accomplices discovered subsequently.
(The ages & location do not match the charges announced with PlutoPete, however.)

<!-- TODO: 14 May followup; https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/32loc7/5_men_in_their_20s_charged_with_drug_offences_on/ -->

[On 28 July 2015](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/697-dark-web-gun-fantasist-pleads-guilty "http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/697-dark-web-gun-fantasist-pleads-guilty"), the 47yo man Ian MacPhee was arrested while serving as the drop for the 38yo man Darren Hillyer ("Emma"), receiving a CD over "a Ruger LC9 9mm handgun and 50 rounds of ammunition" that [Hillyer had ordered from yet another undercover agent on an unnamed market](http://www.onemk.co.uk/news/crime/courts/2015/9/bletchley-gun-fantasist-posing-as-woman-on-the-dark-web-pleads-guilty-at-court-100920150027.html "Bletchley gun fantasist posing as woman on the dark web pleads guilty at court: Man pleads guilty to conspiracy to import firearm and ammunition") (likely not Evolution which had closed March 2015; Agora banned gun sales on 15 July 2015, so that's possible).
MacPhee was fined and Hillyer was [sentenced to 5 years](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/752-dark-web-gun-fantasist-who-wanted-to-be-an-nca-officer "Dark web gun fantasist who wanted to be an NCA officer") in November 2015.

A [29 September 2015 media article](http://www.nottinghampost.com/Nottingham-philosophy-student-caught-importing/story-27890513-detail/story.html "Nottingham philosophy student caught importing cannabis from USA") reported that 21yo college student Benjamin Koops had been sentenced after pleading guilty to importing marijuana from the USA through the 'dark web', which he resold locally to his friends, being busted after "two packages of cannabis were intercepted by the National Crime Agency and traced to Koops". It does not specify the market, whether Customs intercepted the packages, or when he was raided.

The 31yo Bury UK man Montgomery Richard Kyle Byrne [was arrested](http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/montgomery-byrne-jailed-dark-web-10743557 "Man who tried to buy Glock pistol at M6 service station jailed after police sting foils 'dark web' deal: Montgomery Richard Kyle Byrne from Bury was held by the National Crime Agency as he tried to hand over £1,300 for a Glock pistol and 300 rounds of ammunition") [sometime in August 2015](http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/796-dark-web-gun-buyer-sentenced "Dark web gun buyer sentenced to six years") in a gas station restroom trying to pay for a Glock pistol & 300 rounds he arranged on the "dark web"; he pled guilty and was sentenced to 6 years in January 2016.
Details of the case were not given in coverage, but since it was an offline meeting, it is clear that it was not a Customs intercept and that Byrne was buying from yet another flipped or undercover seller account (not weaponsguy, as that account was closed long before August 2015).

The 26yo south London man Dwain Osborne was arrested sometime in October 2015 related to an attempt to buy a Glock pistol & ammo (media: [1](http://converseprisonnews.com/worker-at-brixton-jail-charged-with-trying-to-buy-gun-and-ammo/ "Worker at Brixton jail charged with trying to buy gun and ammo"), [2](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/brixton-prison-librarian-tried-to-buy-gun-on-dark-web-a3191506.html "A Brixton Prison librarian has been charged with attempting to buy a gun on the Dark Web and possessing cocaine with intent to supply"), [3](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/dark-web-brixton-prison-worker-charged-trying-buy-glock-19-handgun-online-1546621 "Dark web: Brixton Prison worker charged with trying to buy Glock 19 handgun online")); it is unspecified which DNM. He was busted because ["the dealer who offered to sell him the gun and ammunition was a US agent"](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/drugdealing-prison-librarian-bought-gun-on-the-dark-web-a3259961.html "Drug-dealing prison librarian bought gun on the 'dark web'").
He was bailed but a search in February 2016 turned up cocaine, packaging material, passports & a police uniform, and information on the prison he worked at.

In late October 2015, 19yo Welsh woman Megan Schadeberg was charged with attempting to buy a Glock pistol, ostensibly for suicide; she told her psychiatrist and he informed the authorities, and was committed in March 2016.
(media: [1](http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Teenager-tried-buy-Glock-pistol-dark-web-books/story-28949305-detail/story.html "Teenager who tried to buy Glock pistol on 'dark web' had books on mass shootings in bedroom"),

She had read up on the DNMs and had acquired Bitcoin and picked a Glock listing on an unspecified DNM, but apparently had not yet pulled the trigger on her order.

[22yo Stirling man Mark Dornan](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-36530120 "'Dark web' drug dealer jailed after parcel intercepted") ordered 500g of marijuana for local resale from Belgium which was intercepted by Customs and he was raided on 8 April 2016.

In June 2016, [Exeter couple Kelly & Ross Brennan were raided](http://www.derryjournal.com/news/courts/english-couple-in-court-accused-of-supplying-diazepam-into-northern-ireland-1-7441207 "English couple in court accused of supplying Diazepam into Northern Ireland") after packages of diazepam sent to customers in Ireland were intercepted and traced back to them; they had been buying diazepam (and bank card for fraud) off the 'dark web' and reselling them to Irish customers using social media/email.

21yo Smethwick man Moynul Haque ordered a Glock pistol from an unspecified seller "between April 1 and May 10" 2015; the seller shipped it from Michigan but was already being investigated by LE, who followed him to the post office & intercepted his package, and turned the information over to UK police, who raided Haque, turning up some amphetamine and his computer's records detailing his order. (media: [1](http://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-news/2016/06/30/gun-parts-importer-influenced-by-tv-and-video-games/ "Gun parts importer 'influenced by TV and video games': A recluse who tried to import gun parts to the Black Country may have been influenced by television and video games, a court heard"), [2](http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/man-who-bought-glock-pistol-11538095 " Man who bought Glock pistol parts on 'dark web' is jailed "), [3](http://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-news/2016/05/30/gun-importer-told-to-reveal-why-he-ordered-weapon-online/ "Gun importer told to reveal why he ordered weapon online: A judge has ordered a man to come clean about his plans to import parts of a high powered gun into this country"))
He was sentenced June 2015 to 10 months.

### USA

On 25 November 2013, Brandon Howell [was arrested](http://www.wect.com/story/24088516/police-seized-hundreds-of-drugs-in-carolina-beach-bust) after "a month-long investigation" in North Carolina; he & his partner "imported MDMA from China through an online black market...The two then resold the imported drugs using the online currency Bitcoin, according to police." It is not clear which seller they were or what market they sold on, but the media coverage mentions Silk Road 1.

On 20 June 2014, the Boise Idaho buyer Jasen Crisp received a CD of a 100g package of MDMA he had ordered from Canada ([press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao-id/pr/boise-man-admits-importing-ecstasy-united-states), #1:14-cr-00226-EJL) and cooperated; his lawyer's [sentencing filing](/docs/sr/2015-01-29-jasencrisp-defensesentencingletter.pdf) writes that he used an "electronic currency" to use the "uncommon means" of ordering on the Internet from "a secret marketplace", so Crisp clearly ordered off one of the DNMs, but it remains unclear which market and which seller.

On the Bungee54 forums, the customer service account "Santos L. Helperb" [said on 2014-10-20](/docs/sr/bungee54-forums-20141105-4162-deliverytimes.html "Bungee54 Member Assembly → Shipping → Delivery times: (Page 6 of 7); http://bungee54ft2us2fs.onion/viewtopic.php?pid=4162"), in response to customers fretting over claims of CDs on Reddit, that Bungee54 in the past 4 months had had only two buyer incidents: "1 was a controlled delivery in US around July - buyer had been investigated before. None of both orders were above 25g".
While the drug & timing is similar (MDMA, late June vs "around July"), this US buyer cannot be Jasen Crisp: Bungee54 did not ship from Canada, Crisp did not have a prior record (that I found), and his intercepted MDMA order was >4x larger than this one.

At the same time as Operation Onymous, the [FBI raided a home in West Haven, Connecticut](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/multimedia/walthandelsman/10766235-171/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home) [~6 November 2014](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home); it is unknown whether anyone was arrested or what market they may have been associated with.
(Speculation so far has only suggested the Agora seller "Nawlins".)

The FBI also [raided a New Orleans, Louisiana](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home "FBI raid of Marigny home part of global crackdown on 'Dark Web'") 6 November 2014, but similarly nothing is known about the results.

The original [Operation Onymous press release](http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/press/PressReleases/Pages/2014/2014-11-07.aspx "Global action against darknet markets on Tor network") boasted of 17 arrests, involving LE from "Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the USA" (["the arrests were scattered over the US and Europe."](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/07/silk-road-20-operation-onymous-dark-web-drugs-takedown)); not all of these are market-connected as they could also be related to scam sites, seller shops, or running content sites (doxbins, revenge porn, etc) and the original releases counted seized websites [in the most inflated way possible](https://www.nikcub.com/posts/onymous-part1/ "Large Number of Tor Hidden Sites Seized by the FBI in Operation Onymous were Clone or Scam Sites"):

1. Blake Benthall; San Francisco, California USA; SR2 operator

3. ???; [New Orleans, Louisiana USA](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home "FBI raid of Marigny home part of global crackdown on 'Dark Web'"); ???
4. ???; [Budapest, Hungary; Hydra operator](http://www.deepdotweb.com/2014/11/11/watch-alleged-hydra-market-admin-getting-busted-in-budapest/)
5. David Schell; California USA; SR2 seller CaliforniaCanibas (the press release is dated 2014-11-07, and the Schells seem to have been arrested the day before, 2014-11-06, so they are probably included in the count)
6. Teri Schell; California USA; SR2 seller CaliforniaCanibas
7. ???; Switzerland; [operator of the scam site "Black Market"](http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-FBI-fait-interpeller-un-Vaudois-chez-lui/story/24253596 "Le FBI fait interpeller un Vaudois chez lui Darknet: Un informaticien est accusé d'avoir créé un site de vente d'armes, de drogues et de faux papiers.")
8. ???; Barcelona Spain; [seems to have been the operator of a scam site](http://www.guardiacivil.es/es/prensa/noticias/5146.html "La Guardia Civil detiene a uno de los objetivos de la macro operación ONYMOUS contra los mercados clandestinos en la Deep Web") ([translation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2m3eyo/some_onymous_bust_in_spain/)) claiming to sell carding-related goods, perhaps "Super Note Counter" or "Sol's Unified USD Counterfeit's" or "Fast Cash!" (all named in the [Operation Onymous seizure papers](/docs/sr/20141107-operationonymous-seizureforfeiture.pdf))
9. 6 UK arrests; 3 have been named publicly, and the charges suggest 1 seller & 2 buyers (unknown which)
10. Ireland: 2 arrests
10. France seized [2 servers](http://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2014/11/11/les-coulisses-de-l-operation-onymous-contre-des-dizaines-de-sites-caches-illegaux_4521827_4408996.html "Les coulisses de l'opération « Onymous » contre des dizaines de sites cachés illégaux; L'opération a été menée conjointement par le FBI et Europol, et était en préparation depuis plus de six mois"), and "several" people were arrested in Germany
10. this gives a final total of:

     - USA: Benthall + the Schells = 3
     - Hungary: Hydra = 1
     - Spain & Switzerland = 2 (fraudsters)
     - UK: 6
     - German: ???
     - Ireland: 2
     - 14 known arrests; 3 are missing, but at least 2 must be German arrests, and hypothetically the last could be from any combination of the mentioned participating countries unrepresented in the above list ("...Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, ... Romania, Sweden") but is probably German as well

On 6 January 2015, the [Princeton student Julian Edgren was arrested](http://planetprinceton.com/2015/01/07/princeton-university-student-arrested-for-drug-possession/ "Princeton University Student Arrested for Drug Possession") & later [pled guilty](http://www.centraljersey.com/news/princeton-former-university-student-pleads-guilty-on-drug-charges/article_9635a3a8-23fb-11e5-9217-8b73683508f0.html "PRINCETON: Former university student pleads guilty on drug charges") after a CD package of MDMA, and was sentenced [to 5 years in September 2015](http://www.centraljersey.com/news/princeton-former-university-student-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison/article_5ec200ac-6617-11e5-aca4-2be1c379d706.html "PRINCETON: Former university student sentenced to five years in prison for selling drugs") of which [he served 0.33 years](http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2016/10/former-u-student-convicted-of-drug-possession-released-early-not-re-enrolled/ "Former U. student convicted of drug possession released early, not re-enrolled"); warrants also turned up mushrooms/psilocybin, marijuana, LSD, hashish, and Adderall.
It is known Edgren had been a The Marketplace customer, but TMP had closed down months before January 2015 after Operation Onymous, so he could not have been using TMP for that order.
(The pricing [might suggest a Canadian source](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2robda/possibly_dnm_related_buyer_arrest/cnif309).)

On 23 February 2015, the South Carolinian man Joseph Patrick Gelli received a summons for a money-laundering charge related to $30k of Bitcoin he had purchased through Coinbase using cash deposited to his bank account ([indictment](/docs/sr/gelliindictment-3-15-cr-00086-MBS-2-main.pdf); [press release](http://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/lexington-man-pleads-guilty-money-laundering-charge-using-bitcoin "Lexington Man Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charge Using Bitcoin")); a search of his home at an unknown point also turned up cash and "marijuana and psychotropic mushrooms" (presumably psilocybin).
He apparently had been buying off an unspecified DNM for local resale, but given the money-laundering focus, it seems unlikely that he suffered the usual fate of a customer snitching.

On 3 March 2015, the Indiana University student Andrew Thrall was arrested for importing Xanax pills from Canada which [he had bought "online using bit coins"](http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/03/delta-tau-delta-member-arrested-for-dealing-xanax "Delta Tau Delta member arrested for dealing Xanax") and [resold to his fraternity](http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/iu-student-accused-of-dealing-drugs-from-fraternity-house "IU student accused of dealing drugs from fraternity house"); the investigation apparently began November 2014, but the media articles did not mention what triggered it (a Customs intercept? or related to the local reselling).
The seller & market are unknown (suggested sellers include [Quantik](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantikXanax/comments/2y6wtn/indiana_1k_pills_bust_official_response/), Magicman, & Yacht club).

On 26 March 2015, New Jersey man [Michael Regan was arrested in a CD of LSD ordered from the Netherlands](http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2015/03/trenton_man_arrested_on_drug_charges_after_accepti.html "Trenton man arrested on drug charges after accepting package containing LSD").

On the same day, 26 March 2015, Alabama man [Ryan Andrew Backer was also arrested](http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/28631102/teen-arrested-after-allegedly-buying-lsd-online "Teen arrested after allegedly buying LSD online") after a search turned up the LSD he had "ordered...online from a source in the Netherlands".
While neither order is stated to have been DNM-related, several factors suggest strongly that these two cases are: the simultaneous arrests is unusual but common when a seller has been profiled and multiple packages can be intercepted simultaneously; LSD is particularly difficult to intercept by Customs; both men are young; the quantities are small; Backer's order is explicitly said to have been online rather than through other channels; and German & Dutch sellers have been having particular difficulty 2014-2015.
(If so, then the specific seller may have been "HollandOnline".)

In January 2016, the fourth arrest of a bust centering around [4 Shelter Island, NY men](http://shelterislandreporter.timesreview.com/2016/01/28/shelter-island-police-make-drug-bust-in-the-bronx/ "Shelter Island Police make drug bust in the Bronx") was made, involving fentanyl, alprazolam, cocaine and oxycodone through the mail & DNMs, although coverage was vague about whether the 4 men were selling from Shelter Island or were buying to resell locally: "According to the police, those arrests last year came out of an investigation centering on powerful prescription and nonprescription drugs sent to the Island through the U.S. Mail. The investigation also uncovered use of black market Internet sites - the so-called "Dark Web," or sites difficult to trace - counterfeit currency and the use of Bitcoin, the digital currency, according to the police...In the case against the three young men, more than 25 packages containing narcotics were sent to the Island through the U.S. Mail, including fentanyl, alprazolam, cocaine and oxycodone, police said. Prescription drugs in tablet form were taken into evidence along with non-prescription narcotics in powder form. Electronic messaging and payments, including money orders and other fund transfers, were used to order and pay for the drugs from distributors off-Island, according to the police."

In March 2016, charges were announced against 3 NY men, 30yo Richard Petix / 20yo Zhe Wang / 20yo Kevin Szura (case `1:2016-cr-00026`; [press release](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdny/pr/three-men-indicted-district-s-first-bitcoin-related-case "Three Men Indicted On District's First Bitcoin-Related Case"), [complaint](/docs/sr/2016-petix-complaint.pdf), [media](http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/three-new-yorkers-indicted-sale-xanax-bitcoin/ "Three New Yorkers Indicted Over Sale of Xanax for Bitcoin: U.S authorities accuse the men of operating "an unlicensed money transmitting business" for selling smuggled drugs in bitcoin")).
Petix had sold Bitcoin to an undercover agent, as he had to Wang/Szura; in an undercover buy beginning 29 February 2016, they admitted using the bitcoins to import MDMA & Xanax from a Canadian DNM seller for resale locally, and were arrested at the second one 7 March 2016.

On 17 March 2016, 22yo Arkansas man Christian Olson was arrested for weekly orders of ~3lb marijuana from California paid in Bitcoin which he resold locally ([1](http://www.11alive.com/mb/news/local/22-year-old-made-16kmonth-after-shipping-pot-through-usps/100506739 "22-year-old made $16K/month after shipping pot through USPS"),

On 3 May 2016, 20yo [Pennsylvania college student Michael Mancini was arrested](http://www.phillyvoice.com/prosecutors-chesco-student-used-bitcoins-buy-lsd-dark-web/ " Prosecutors: Chester County student used bitcoins to buy LSD off Dark Web; East Stroudsburg University student arrested, charged"); a fellow student seems to have informed the police and perhaps his dorm director [that he was reselling small amounts of LSD](http://www.mcall.com/news/local/police/mc-n-east-stroudsburg-dark-web-lsd-20160505-story.html " ESU student busted buying LSD on the 'dark web', police say"), who then began inspecting his mail, leading to an interception of an LSD order from Hawaii & subsequent search & arrest.

In the UK gun case of Moynul Haque, media coverage mentions that "The court heard Haque purchased the goods from an American man via the dark web, a secretive section of the World Wide Web used for criminal activity. Homeland Security agents were investigating the US citizen, and in April last year followed him to a post office where they intercepted a parcel addressed to Haque's home in Brasshouse Lane, Smethwick, where he lived with his parents and three siblings." (specifically, "between April 1 and May 10" 2015)
No further details are known about who this Michigan gun seller is or when they were arrested.

On 29 October 2015, University of Buffalo student Zhe Wang was raided over Xanax sales; after sales to an undercover officer on 29 February 2016, Zhe Wang & Kevin Szura were arrested for MDMA & Xanax ([complaint](/docs/sr/zhewang-complaint-nywd-12903502170.pdf); [media](http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/police-courts/former-ub-student-admits-using-bitcoins-while-dealing-in-drugs-20160823 "Former UB student admits using bitcoins while dealing in drugs")).

## Utopia

Utopia was a market launched after the fall of SR1 by ~2 BMR staffers as a competitor and then when BMR decided to shut down, a replacement.
Shockingly, it was raided by Dutch police a week after its official opening - it turned out that the staffers had already been infiltrated while working for BMR, 5 Dutch & German men were arrested, and the servers seized.
The sequence of events is a bit difficult to determine from the Dutch-language sources; but it seems that the Dutch investigation made contact with a BMR staffer and talked about buying 1 kilo of cocaine, the staffer agreed and met them offline on 6 March 2013, tried to hire the Dutch UC for a hit on an unspecified person, surveillance of them/cars & their phones (text messages & calls discussing their drug deals & Utopia), one of them arrested 4 October 2013 in Woudenberg while transporting kilos of MDMA/cocaine/marijuana/amphetamines, the Utopia servers were apparently living at one of their homes, and presumably the rest writes itself.

# Unconfirmed rumors

Sending drugs through the mail turns out to be a surprisingly common practice, and there are many cases of people being busted for receiving packages of drugs (particularly with the rise of marijuana legalization in American states), sometimes through online mechanisms (eg Instagram).
The [Drugs Global Incident Map](http://drugs.globalincidentmap.com/) features many online-related busts, and long lists can be compiled from law enforcement press releases & local news media.[^Reddit-lists-1][^Reddit-lists-2][^Reddit-lists-3][^Reddit-lists-4][^Reddit-lists-5][^Reddit-lists-6][^Reddit-lists-7]

Most are likely unrelated to the DNMs (part of regular drug smuggling or importing from fly-by-night chemical labs in China) and some rumors are wrong or flatly made up (for example, a seller may be covering up an exit scam with a fake story about being busted, or one seller may be trying to hurt another's sales eg [the TedDanzig incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1xq97t/teddanzig_arrested/) or the 4lb PureFireMeds FUD), but of course, some will turn out to be real.

## Australia

A [Reddit user in March 2014](https://pay.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/20akta/police_asking_for_statement/) claims that he was approached by police using information from an unspecified SR1 seller being prosecuted. No confirmation.

The [Agora seller Ripefreefly](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/24zt2o/ripefreefly_busted_or_scam_what_do_i_do/) reportedly claimed in May 2014 on his seller page to have been busted and was pleading guilty; his story has some issues and I have seen no confirmation.

On 26 August 2014, a ["cook"/underground-lab for steroids was busted in Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2esz2q/all_markets_ugloz_busted_by_feds/ck2ttbn); this may have been the supplier for the SR2 steroids seller "UGLOZ" and related to why UGLOZ apparently began scamming in early August according to the [SR2F](/docs/sr/sr2f-20140831-uglozcomplaintthread.html "*****BEWARE***** UGLOZ ***** SCAMMERS *****").

A Bendigo, Victoria gang leader, 25yo Dean Poot, was [arrested 17 May 2016 for methamphetamine trafficking](http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/story/4057769/alleged-bendigo-drug-kingpin-refused-bail/ "Alleged Bendigo drug kingpin refused bail"); the meth was imported by mail and the "dark web" may have been involved in some fashion.

## Germany

The Bungee54 group was a respected high-volume bulk seller of MDMA based in Germany/Netherlands, selling on the bigger marketplaces and their own shop; their scale (they must have been turning over at least €1m annually) meant they were a LE target and if they were not, still liable to trigger investigations through packages being intercepted and profiled.
As such there were tremendous speculation that members had been flipped & the group had been or would soon be busted (eg.
[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2joxdl/bungee54_raid_federal_investigation/),
[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2jjwgj/bungee54_shipping_delays/),

[7](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2jqmok/what_should_those_who_have_dealt_with_bungee54_do/))
much like Shiny Flakes had been, and after Operation Onymous, Bungee54 [temporarily](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2l9ap8/bungee54_says_goodbye_good_luck_to_everyone/) [retired](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2looal/bungee54_state_of_operations_update/).
One staffer told me that while a sysadmin had a close shave (anonymity-wise) during Operation Onymous, but no arrest reports have come out of Germany which sound like them as of April 2015 so they probably succeeded in a clean shutdown.

The German Agora seller "RedBull" disappeared February 2015, citing a [German police](http://www.berlin.de/polizei/polizeimeldungen/pressemitteilung.261025.php "Durchsuchungsbeschlüsse und Haftbefehle nach Drogenhandel und") [raid](http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article137039614/Razzia-Berliner-Polizei-sprengt-Spandauer-Dealer-Ring.html "Razzia - Berliner Polizei sprengt Spandauer Dealer-Ring: Bei den Durchsuchungen in Berlin fanden die Ermittler Marihuana, Amphetamin, eine schussbereite Pistole und mehrere Zehntausend Euro Bargeld. Die Tatverdächtigen wurden festgenommen.") which on 2 February 2015 rounded up a total of 11 men for marijuana, amphetamines, weapons, forgery of official documents & credit cards, and "[gefälschte Wertzeichen](http://www.rechtslexikon.net/d/geld-und-wertzeichenf%C3%A4lschung/geld-und-wertzeichenf%C3%A4lschung.htm "Geld- und Wertzeichenfälschung")" which probably refers to faking postal stamps (to save money on shipments).
It's unknown whether RedBull was one of them or remains at liberty.

A 26yo Wendelstein man Franz K bought [203g of hash & marijuana from "Atlas 2012" or "Ronny Kolbenzurichter"](http://www.infranken.de/regional/forchheim/Im-Darknet-mit-Drogen-gehandelt-Kripo-entlarvt-neun-Maenner-aus-Franken;art216,1355609 "Drogenbestellung im Darknet: Wendelsteiner vor Gericht") and was sentenced on 5 January 2016 to 9 months.

## Israel

On 5 July 2013, [Israeli police announced 30 arrests](http://www.police.gov.il/articlePage.aspx?aid=1587 "30 נעצרו בחשד שסחרו בסמים מסוכנים ברשת: במהלך החקירה הסמויה ביצעו החוקרים קניות מבוימות מאתרים שונים בהם השתמשו החשודים, לצורך הסחר בסמים"); Google Translate indicates that these arrests were related to online sellers of "dangerous drugs" using the "darknet" and possibly Bitcoins after Israeli law enforcement made undercover purchases, but no market is specified and it seems hard to believe that as many as 30 people could be busted without any notice being taken on SR1/BMR (the main markets in July 2013).

The Israeli man [Petah Tikva was CDed 12 May 2015](http://www.xn--4dbcyzi5a.com/2015/05/%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%93-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%94%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%A1-%D7%A6%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%97%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A7/ "מהולנד באהבה: נתפס צעיר שהזמין חבילות קנאביס בדואר") for marijuana sent from the Netherlands. <!-- 24yo -->

## Netherlands

Posts on the SR2F claimed that the MDMA seller "Checkpoint" had been busted and customers raided; see his [review thread](/docs/sr/sr2f-20141106-3717-checkpointreviewthread.html) and [a customer claim of raid](/docs/sr/sr2f-20141104-52461-checkpointcustomerraid.html) due to poor stealth.

## New Zealand (NZ)

A 30yo man Luke William Taylor [was arrested during Operation Hyderabad (sometime around November 2014)](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/65443284/accused-in-horowhenua-drugs-case-out-on-bail.html "Accused in Horowhenua drugs case out on bail") [for importing methamphetamine, MDMA, & LSD](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/69472334/kiwi-man-jailed-for-posting-drugs-from-las-vegas-to-mothers-house "Kiwi man jailed for posting drugs from Las Vegas to mother's house") from the USA & Germany to use & resell.
Silk Road is mentioned in the two media articles but despite suggestive aspects like his importing stopping around when SR2 closed, Taylor is not said to have used it.

A [Reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarketsNZ/comments/2tdk8a/custom_bust_5_tabs_of_lsd/) claims on 22 January 2015 to have, "a few months ago" ordered LSD from Canada, which was intercepted and been knock-and-talked by Customs.

[On 24 October 2015, a group of 8 New Zealand soldiers](http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/79804077/two-soldiers-appear-in-court-martial-accused-of-taking-nbomb "Two soldiers appear in court martial accused of taking 'N-Bomb'") (apparently all male) at a party purchased MDMA from apparently an acquaintance they met outside the bar; the MDMA turned out to be a NBOMe that may or may not have been purchased on a "Silk Road-like website" as the media writeups are unclear; several of them had a bad trip, and were arrested. Of them, 5 were discharged, and 3 court-martialed; 2 of those were found guilty but [not discharged](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/79942374/nbomb-soldiers-want-to-stay-in-defence-force "'N-bomb' soldiers to be sent to military prison but remain in army").

## Sheep

[A Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1riid6/i_am_a_corrections_officerwe_now_have_our_first/) claims to be a US corrections officer and that one of his inmates was a Sheep buyer reselling locally who was turned in by his girlfriend and then arrested after a controlled buy.

[A poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/SheepMarketplace/comments/1rnf0d/the_weed_vendor_hanfliebhaber_apparently_has_been/) claims that the German marijuana seller "Hanfliebhaber" ("cannabis lovers") on Sheep Marketplace was busted before 28 November 2013 due to reuse of a single post office, and that details are available on the Sheep forums; unfortunately, I did not save a copy before the site & forums disappeared in an exit scam, and have been unable to find any confirmation other than one or two forum posts in German elsewhere complaining about a scam or speculating he had been arrested.

## UK

[A November 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/2m2ih4/got_arrested_with_alleged_320grams_of_weed_sent/) claim of a CD for marijuana from Mexico in January 2013.

There is an anonymous claim of a May 2013 [UK controlled delivery & arrest](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ewt7k/uk_arrest/).
([Possibly ketamine](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/273gjq/controlled_delivery_in_the_uk/chxhr2x)?)

Similarly, [one Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1ewt7k/uk_arrest/) claims on 23 May 2013 that an acquaintance was CDed 22 May 2013 for an international package of pills ordered from SR1.

[A Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2gwej3/true_cases_of_small_time_buyers_being_arrested/ckn7imx) claimed on 19 September 2014 that the British man [John Watt](http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/carlisle-man-who-had-ecstasy-tablets-sent-to-friend-s-house-jailed-1.1061538) & friend who were arrested for a package of MDMA from Holland had ordered it off SR1.

[A Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2juko5/interways_raid_by_police/) claims in early October 2014 to have been raided after buying MDMA & "speed" from Interways off SR2.

[A November 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2m353r/i_dont_know_what_to_think/) claim that "My friend got a lb seized from Canada got raided 2 days after he got the seizure letter".

A [Reddit rumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2vn7tt/vendor_busted/) claims a "big" Evolution marijuana seller was arrested 10 February 2015 (possibly Newport, Skyvype, or Hera).

## USA

A [pseudonymous Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1o6whp/attention_i_just_made_bail_as_a_buyer/ccpnnh7) claims to have been arrested & charged over SR1 cocaine sometime in 2012, but not convicted.

During 2013 Congressional hearings on Bitcoin, the [Department of Homeland Security's letter to the Congressional committee](/docs/sr/2013-congressbitcoinhearings-dhsletter.pdf) made a curious claim:

> The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has partnered with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Drug Enforcement Agency, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on an investigation into the Silk Road...The purpose of this investigation has been to focus on the identification of the site's main administrator, referred to as Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR). Of recent noteworthy interest was the determination that the suspect who had sent Ricin to President Obama earlier this year was a vendor on the Silk Road site.

There were several ricin letters in 2013, whose senders were prosecuted, but I was unable to turn up any kind of link between them and Silk Road and [discussion produced no additional concrete evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1qqmbx/silk_road_vendor_sent_ricin_to_president_obama/) of what this ricin letter was about, which seller, or whether they were arrested.

A SR1F user named "East India Traitor" corresponded with DPR1, probably before June 2013, claiming to share inside information on the LE investigations into SR1 & the DoS attacks and that he had spent 6 months in prison related to SR1 activities; I discount his claims as many of them contradict what is now known about the investigations.

A Redditor claims [a friend was arrested at his PO box](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kluze/has_anyone_in_this_subreddit_actually_ever_gotten/cbqg9h1), a second claims his cousin was [convicted of ordering marijuana & MDMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1f1joh/things_i_learned_from_watching_my_cousin_lose_his/) without a controlled delivery, and there were several claims to have been arrested or convicted [in an August 2013 Reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/1kluze/has_anyone_in_this_subreddit_actually_ever_gotten/) (these claims are not verifiable).

A SR1F rumor claimed that the marijuana seller Maryjanelane [had been arrested](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/24dafo/this_may_be_a_long_shot_but_has_anyone_heard_from/) shortly before the October bust.

Through December 2013 - January 2014, [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetDeals/comments/1s0vwv/usus_eu_pillboxys_deal_sheet_roxies_vicodins/) [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1vzprp/pillboxy_may_be_the_cops_or_law_enforcement/) [throwaways](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1vvqys/pillboxy_le/) began claiming that they were visited or searched by LE from the [former Sheep Marketplace seller "Pillboxy"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SheepMarketplace/comments/1rxwgl/pillboxys_former_vendor_on_sheep_product_offering/) who had shifted to doing orders over `safe-mail.net` email (as well as that he was a [scammer extortionist](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/1w253l/a_fun_new_way_to_get_scammed_or_worse_dark_net/)).
No verifiable details were provided.

A Redditor claims to have been arrested in Virginia in April 2014 while [tripping on 25-NBOMe](http://www.reddit.com/r/SilkRoad/comments/23fsf1/got_arrested_25cnbome_not_lsd/).

On 19 March 2014, in Leesburg Virginia, Thomas C. Watson [was arrested after a controlled delivery](http://www.myfoxdc.com/story/25055460/police-man-allegedly-used-mail-to-transport-drug-molly "Police: Man allegedly used mail to transport drug "molly" to himself") of an intercepted package of oxycodone & MDMA; he wrote ["return to sender" on it & denied any connection](http://www.leesburgtoday.com/crime/leesburg-man-denies-involvement-in-mailed-drugs-case/article_e6a17896-b6a4-11e3-b6b2-001a4bcf887a.html "Leesburg Man Denies Involvement In Mailed Drugs Case"), and ultimately [the charges were dropped](http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/drug_charges_dropped_against_prominent_leesburg_businessman543 "Drug charges dropped against prominent Leesburg businessman").
Because of his technological savvy ("the founder of Capital Computers and Network, an IT company"; cf CALIGIRL) and return-to-sender gambit (sometimes advised as an anti-CD tactic) and the small quantities (suggesting a personal purchase rather than being set up as a drop), speculation was rife that Watson was a DNM buyer, but no concrete evidence ever surfaced.

Around April-May 2014, the SR2 Californian methamphetamine sellers AoD and Chaletla ceased sales, leading [to](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/23qh7y/warning_chaletlatherealchaletla_has_either_turned/) [speculation](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/24p8x9/san_jose_bust_sounds_like_chaletlas_team/) about being busted or linked to a [large Californian bust](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/04/25/silicon-valley-drug-bust-shows-strong-ties-to-mexican-cartels/ "Silicon Valley Drug Bust Shows Strong Ties To Mexican Cartels") [of cartel dealers](http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_25639176/san-jose-meth-bust-leads-arrest-suspected-key "San Jose: Meth bust leads to arrest of suspected key cartel operative, clandestine lab") in methamphetamine & other drugs.

On 15 September 2014, [North Carolinian Scott Patrick Royal was arrested after a CD](http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_87cc5f2c-3e8d-11e4-84f2-338083e94e20.html "Cedar Point man charged in Ecstasy case") for a small order of MDMA pills from Germany; no Bitcoin or Internet connection was mentioned in news article but speculation was [Toyota on Agora](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2hdp5a/caught_having_e_sent_from_germany/).

An anonymous user reports that in November 2014, during a DUI-related search of his car, LE found "a sheet of 25i-NBOMe and some synthetic cannabinoids" he'd bought from Agora, but escaped severe punishment due to a good lawyer & getting into a diversion program; he says the prosecutor was not surprised to hear he'd bought it off Agora.

As part of Operation Onymous, 2 homes were searched by the FBI in [West Haven, Connecticut](http://wtnh.com/2014/11/06/fbi-agents-raid-west-haven-home/ "FBI agents raid West Haven home") & [New Orleans, Louisiana](http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/10766235-123/fbi-raid-of-marigny-home "FBI raid of Marigny home part of global crackdown on 'Dark Web'") on 6 November 2014.
What they found and what arrests they made, if any, remain unknown.

[A Mid-Western Redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkNetMarkets/comments/2m4otd/reporting_a_local_bust_following_operation_onymous/) reports on 12 November 2014 (post-Operation Onymous) that an acquaintance had been arrested after picking up a SR2 package; he says that he was a local reseller of LSD & other psychedelics.

# Analysis
## Opsec/security

No single theme emerges reading through the many arrests.

Some people are busted through sheer bad luck in being randomly pulled over or their packages inspected; some are undone by other peoples' mistakes, and some have no one but themselves to blame for talking to a policeman and blurting out all their secrets; some are undone by their trust in others, and some are undone by lying to federal agents; some are undone by signing for packages, while others are undone by a stray fingerprint; some followed the OPSEC rules and some engaged in mindboggling follies like using their real return address or accepting payment to their own bank account or running their own clearnet site; some clammed up, denied everything, and saved themselves, while others kept records of everything (perhaps in the misguided belief it would earn them clemency in the worst) and only condemned themselves; some were busted at home, others in the totalitarian zones of international borders; some were busted through high-tech browser-based deanonymization but most through low-tech methods like a customer or friend snitching; some sellers' packages are spotted during Customs inspections, and some are noticed only when delivery fails & the bogus return addresses explode.

A few motifs do emerge:

- many buyers go down to CDs and the subsequent searches turning up additional illegal goods, suggesting 2 major mitigations: never signing, and cleaning house to the extent possible when expecting a new delivery
- international deliveries are highly risky for both the seller and the buyer, and Australia/NZ more so
- sellers should be assumed to keep records & addresses; many have turned out to do so
- but simple addresses seem minimally useful to LE as there are few known busts despite the many thousands of captured transaction records with addresses - with a few exceptions:

    1. if the address is from an account which is itself a seller (an argument for single-role accounts)
    2. the seller has been infiltrated but not yet busted, and there are orders 'in flight' which can be turned into quick & easy CDs
    3. the products being sold are guns or poisons, in which case, retrospective arrests may be tried
- Bitcoin works as a payment method: sellers using any other method (Paypal, bank deposits, Western Union) invariably come to grief, and attempted use of such methods may be a red flag for a LE-controlled account
- guns and poisons seem to bring grief to everyone around them: despite being the minutest of categories (sometimes with zero sellers on the markets which permit them), busts of buyers & sellers are well-represented.

    In particular, LE is willing to spend particular efforts following buyers across international borders, makes busts based on records of addresses (as exemplified by the BMR busts in which old customers were followed up on, in contrast to drug busts where thousands of addresses fall into LE hands without visible effect), and operate flipped seller accounts for months (eg the Agora weaponsguy case, where undercover purchases led to a formerly legitimate seller, flipped him, and made dozens of sales/arrests afterwards covered up by coerced positive feedback).

    I tend to think that guns is a difficult category for DNM sellers: such sellers are operating in a low-profit small niche often excluded from DNMs, one which is especially vulnerable to mail interception (metal parts), a product type hard to sell in smaller units (what's 10g of a handgun?), where LE is *very* interested in busting them, and very willing to spend the time & money to do undercover purchases in order to traceback, arrest, flip, trace past buyers, and operate undercover sales to bust future buyers. The paradigmatic examples for me are the web of BMR gun/poison sellers/buyers, a few Evolution ones, and weaponsguy on Agora.

    It's not too surprising that guns would fail as a DNM product category while things like MDMA sell like hotcakes. It is more than a little bit ridiculous to suggest that anyone in the USA who wants a gun might seriously try to buy it on a DNM, when there's something like 350 million guns already floating around the USA which can be easily bought through myriads of avenues, many legally, and transported easily anywhere within the continental USA with cars. (Some of my relatives have accumulated 8 shotguns and rifles of various kinds, and they were hardly even trying or living in a gun-friendly state.) This is probably why so many of the gun DNM arrests are international, especially Australian or English: their gun control is reasonably successful, so the lazy and foolish people see DNMs (too foolish to think seriously about how drugs differ substantially from metal guns in terms of passing Customs or to review the history of arrests and note how many previous DNM gun buyers discovered the hard way that they were purchasing straight from an undercover officer) as the easiest way. Every time I read a gun or ricin DNM arrest, I shake my head at how incompetent they were and how they saw no red flags interacting with the undercover agent^[eg, a *real* ricin seller won't chat you up and remind you that, "you know, ricin can be used to kill people" or discuss how best to do it, since the less they know the better; that's obviously an undercover agent trying to establish _mens reus_ for the judge.]. A fair number come off as just troubled young people, and you have to wonder how much entrapment there was, similar to how the FBI manufactures terrorist plots with its 'informants'.

    This makes evaluating the true risk of guns hard: there are not many gun sellers. They are on only a few DNMs. A gun seller can be legitimate  and accused of scamming because sending guns is hard; they can be legitimate and then flipped by undercover buyers and then become LE; in fact, they can be LE even while 'selling' guns all around the world to dozens of buyers and receiving great feedback! Guns/poisons are a uniquely tricky category because LE uses the full bag of tricks on occasion, while in normal categories like drugs there's only a very few cases of LE doing tricky things like allowing some additional drug shipments to go out (usually involving informants like XanaxKing). But based on how relatively rare guns are, I suspect it is likely the single riskiest category on the DNMs.

## Completeness

How complete is this inventory of arrests, that is, what percentage of *all* DNM related cases are listed in the table? There are many reasons to expect the table to be incomplete:

1. anyone arrested will do their best to minimize any connection to drugs in general, or varieties of conspiracy, RICO, money laundering, or interstate charges which might be entailed by admitting to anything related to the DNMs or Bitcoin
2. if they are arrested and the connection comes out, the case may never become public for many reasons - various legal or privacy regulations may block it, it may simply not hit the media because it was 'just' another local drug case, or it may be deliberately kept secret as part of ongoing investigations (and LE admits as much - in [one article](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-inside-silk-road-20131118-story.html) they are paraphrased as saying "Not all of those charges have been made public.", and other tactics include ["sealing documents, eliminating key information from public documents that point to the investigation - for example, the name Silk Road - or filing state charges instead of federal ones to keep a suspect's records out of the more-easily searched federal court [PACER] database."](http://www.wired.com/2013/11/silk-road/ "Headline: How the Feds Took Down the Silk Road Drug Wonderland")).
3. the information may be public, but media coverage gets it wrong; unsophisticated & overworked journalists routinely confuse the deep web, dark web, forums, etc
4. the media coverage may be right but is not in English
5. etc

Some evidence points weakly at how comprehensive this table may be:

- public cases can be divided into reasonably well-documented ones, and ones inferred from aggregate figures or media blurbs; for example, the bare name of the arrested person is unknown in more than half of the cases
- the aggregate time lags from when each person was arrested to when their case became known (possibly through indirect means such as carefully parsing complaints and evidence from other cases) suggest that ~90% of public cases become known in the first year but then there is a very long tail of arrests surfacing in the public record years later, implying that for 2012 onwards each year cannot be >90% complete even if we assumed that all cases became public (because for more recent years, cases have not finished surfacing)
- the informant Carl Force told DPR that there had been many account compromises on BMR and "a few quiet busts", where at the most generous, only 3 cases are known, suggesting a known:total BMR rate of <33%
- in SR1, the UK press release specified the total number of arrests; the UK arrests remain otherwise unknown
- in the Xanax King case, a subsequent court filing specified the full number of related arrests, which can be compared with media articles on identified or likely XK buyers, suggesting a known:total rate of ~10%
- in Operation Onymous, the joint press release specified the total number of arrests; many are still unknown
- the Ross Ulbricht trial revealed several unknown arrests (at a minimum: Deezletime, alllove, Richard Bates) which would likely have never surfaced if Ulbricht had plea-bargained and avoided trial
- Australian police have sometimes quoted aggregate Silk Road-related figures; an example is the statement that 6 Australians were arrested in June 2013 for SR1-related activities, yet, information about only one has been uncovered so far.
- the long-running "weaponsguy" Agora gun sting yielded, according to a press release, 17 arrests globally; only 1 arrest is known otherwise.

In aggregate, I would guess that the completeness of the table is highly unlikely to be >25% and more likely to be <=10% (but the completeness is probably much higher for site operators, then staff, then sellers, and least of all buyers).

Liam Reynolds (21yo) 4 years jail, 9 others (suspended sentences)

> While Reynolds was jailed for four years, Nicholas O'Brien, 21, Jordan Crowney, 21, George Cosgrove, 22, Daniel Bernard, 21, Paul Simms, 21, Thomas Cox, 21, Connor Woods, 20, Joseph Wilson, 21, and Stephen Coleman, 21, were all given suspended sentences for their part in the drug ring - meaning they escaped prison time.

The police, after receiving information that the group were involved in drugs, seized a large parcel of cannabis and other evidence following a thorough investigation by Leeds detectives.

Text messages with overt references to drug transactions were found alongside photos of members of the group posing with drugs and cash.

Following a lengthy investigation, 10 members of the group were charged with a range of offences in May last year which included conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and conspiracy to import controlled drugs.
