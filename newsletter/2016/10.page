Politics/religion:

- ["The Long-Term Effects of Cash Assistance"](https://web.stanford.edu/~djprice/papers/djprice_jmp.pdf), Price & Song 2016 (A very unusually long-term followup to one of the old American basic income experiments. No large harmful effects... but no obvious benefits either, nothing remotely like we observe in the Third World BI experiments. And if money helps with social outcomes, it should've helped more in the 1970s than it does now, so I feel more pessimistic about Give Directly/YC's USA BI experiment.﻿)

Statistics/meta-science/mathematics:

- ["Active Learning Literature Survey"](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf), Settles 2010

    You can see this as a way to most economically increase your dataset size by only labeling the most valuable instances; it can also be used to improve dataset quality by targeting instead the errors a model makes on a noisy corpus for examination by the oracle; and finally, it can be seen as a demonstration of the advantages of reinforcement learning over simple supervised learning over heaps of data - given the curse of dimensionality, most data is useless for training a model because it is so redundant and already a solved problem, and the data the model needs to improve its performance is a needle in a haystack. So by giving a model RL capabilities, you improve its supervised/inference performance! The way I put this: "tool AIs want to be agent AIs".
