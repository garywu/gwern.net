This is the November 2016 edition of [the `gwern.net` newsletter](https://gwern.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ed1f6b2799208b40f5f18be8f&id=91b4d51355); previous, [October 2016](https://www.gwern.net/newsletter/2016/10) ([archives](https://www.gwern.net/tags/newsletter)).
This is a summary of the revision-history RSS feed, overlapping with my [Changelog](https://gwern.net/Changelog) & [Google+](https://plus.google.com/103530621949492999968); brought to you by my donors on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gwern).

Everything is heritable:

    - dysgenics: ["Genome-wide analysis identifies 12 loci influencing human reproductive behavior"](https://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/correlation/2016-barban.pdf), Barban et al 2016 ([supplement](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v48/n12/extref/ng.3698-S2.xls); [genetic correlations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_correlation) with fewer later offspring: _r~g~_ = -0.236 and 0.712 respectively. Cross-sectional confirmation of [Conley et al 2016's](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/05/25/1523592113.full "Assortative mating and differential fertility by phenotype and genotype across the 20th century") discovery of longitudinal dysgenics.)

Presumably ancient genomes would show even more dramatic population collapses & selection in South/Central America.)
    - ["Kinship, Fractionalization and Corruption"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2847222), Akbari et al 2016
    - ["CRISPR gene-editing tested in a person for the first time"](http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-tested-in-a-person-for-the-first-time-1.20988 "The move by Chinese scientists could spark a biomedical duel between China and the United States")
- ["Polygenic transmission disequilibrium confirms that common and rare variation act additively to create risk for autism spectrum disorders"](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/23/089342), Weiner et al 2016
- ["Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals First Locus for Anorexia Nervosa and Metabolic Correlations"](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/25/088815), Duncan et al 2016 (see also ["The Thin Gene"](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/sunday/the-thin-gene.html))

- human-level lipreading (human-level lipreading + MSR's transcription + Google's WaveNet could have major implications for the deaf & hard-of-hearing and the role of sign language):

    - ["Lip Reading Sentences in the Wild"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05358v1.pdf), Chung et al 2016 ([vide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aogzAUPilE))

- ["Outrageously large neural networks: the sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts layer"](http://openreview.net/pdf?id=B1ckMDqlg), Shazeer et al 2016 (This is cool. The main net is a little NN which chooses a couple out of a few thousand other NNs to do the real computation. Because only a couple subnets are activated at any time and the others are silent, they are effectively small specialized NNs - which accordingly fit in the GPU and are very fast forwards/backwards. Instead of the complications of learning to use an external memory, huge datasets can effectively be sharded & memorized by individual specialized sub NNs.)
- ["Google's Multilingual Neural Machine Translation System: Enabling Zero-Shot Translation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04558), Johnson et al 2016; ["Found in translation: More accurate, fluent sentences in Google Translate"](https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/) (the long-awaited high quality translation RNNs finally get rolled out to the masses)
- ["Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Nets"](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/), Isola et al 2016 (as has often been noted, mapping images to images is a very common type of operation, and there's no real reason to have a whole menagerie of DCGANs for upscaling *and* colorizing *and* inpainting *and*...)
