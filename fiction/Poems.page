# Spring

    None remain to see,
    under pouring skies, the first
    strawberry ripen

    Long after petting
    the armies of black insects
    march across the floor
    as my cat wages fierce war
    for hours on clumps of fur

    With a sudden swear
    lifting my tea mug; for there
    - even more cat hair!

    The sun will rise, yes,
    but the mayflies live today;
    cold comfort is it
    that the storm flies tomorrow
    and the sun will rise again

    fireflies flashing
    fulgently in furrowed fields
    an old vet shivers
    the scars of love, life, and death
    soon laved & lifted by death

# Summer

    Down on the grasses,
    I gaze at the summer sun -
    And it gazes back!

    The party over
    beer bottles and fireflies
    duet in twilight

    Our revels over,
    gleaming bottles remain;
    and beneath full moons,
    the summer fireflies dance -
    flaring, sparkling, redoubled

    "It is not injust
    to take that which none complains";
    so I tell myself
    behind the abandoned house
    where ripens the green apple

    Cooling and ceaseless,
    some rejoice in summer rains
    - earth worms' worlds' ending

    This full August moon
    Is the only they will know
    So go on, cry on,
    You cicadas in the trees!
    I will wait for the next moon.

"Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge":

    Ivory arcing
    Over river scales shining -
    The Caroboros!

    Sudden squeal and stop -
    Was the sky always so blue?
    Laying back, thinking.

    Fearful fireflies
    Twinkle in the distant dark,
    But driving at night
    At sixty miles per hour
    I meet none along the way

    Bright lights ahead swerve;
    seeing nothing, I too turn.
    Thus it is for men,
    through the ages - the leader blind,
    the follower blinded.

On a sudden shower in the gloaming:

    Looking up from work,
    we see dark clouds of the rain,
    a summer storm starts.
    We stop, free, guilt-less, sin-less;
    cares drop like the rain.
    All is silent, all is cool
    - we can't work in wet.
    No blame descends but the rain
    and shining sunlight
    and green leaves in the bright-dark.
    Dust, go with the rain:
    let no one think or worry
    but have calm clear minds
    sitting, waiting on the rain,
    content, for once, in
    a life of clouded choices
    hidden by the rain.
    Somewhere someone is slaying,
    dying, or crying -
    none are bitter in the rain
    - a worm eats an eye,
    a blood vessel bursts a brain -
    here under the rain,
    but here it is green, and kind,
    and time does not pass
    until work returns to mind
    and we leave the rain
    for the dust of desires.
    Only drops remain,
    And the world, us defiled,
    Us, the world defiling;
    each of us working to bring
    that last rainstorm without end.

# Fall

    Autumn leaves floating
    on the white-crested waters
    slowly, the trees send
    year-end letters home to
    their mother, the sea

    Water raising moon
    into the sky as of old...
    And they felt this too?
    - all symbols are reflections,
    they wept for it and for them.

    With the autumn sun
    my birthday comes, and it goes;
    and the leftover
    presents' discarded wrappings
    remind me of my own fate.

    Death poems are all just
    falling blossoms and nonsense:
    dying is dying

Papermachine wrote:

    What zeal!
    the wild nights spent burning
    candles,
    running up mountains,
    churning through paper

Reply:

    With such zeal and joy
    did I burn those wild nights
    in the candle light,
    bounding up paper piles
    and scaling mountains of thought

Coda:

    Now decade the third,
    and what do I have to show?
    A pile of words
    whose value I do not know -
    and the cold autumn winds blow

    "Where has the time gone?"
    I wonder in my study,
    rain on the windows;
    and the years drip down on me
    as yellowed papers

# Winter

    With the melting frost,
    this winter my dog departs.
    Only snow returns
    again and again; and we
    too must vanish like the dew.

    Our lives are rivers
    that endlessly flow into
    quiet seas of death

    Less bitter by far
    is tea steeped overnight than
    sudden betrayal,
    and a life filled only with
    the dregs of disappointment.

    Cold as the ashes
    of the fire now gone out
    is a man's shadow
    staring at nothing at all
    with nothing left he can do.

    Sharper than snake fangs
    and shards of stone on the floor
    is a son leaving
    a suddenly silent room -
    never to be seen again.

12:05 gwern> hm, reminds me of a classic Teika poem... let's parody it. 'go tell them in the / Valley that on the rocks of / the island of Alcatraz  / the tulip flowers yet bloom'

21:22 gwern> Mqrius: hah, reminds me of that basho haiku - 'frog / library/ ibid!'

14:27 gwern> hm. 'Loneliness - until / the chill wind blew through the pine trees / I had not known I / was so alone, and as I / wrap myself, I shiver.'

12:23 gwern> rain on a sunday - / a postal worker somewhere / sees clouds and smiles
13:05 gwern> The mailman will come, / though hell and high water rise, / and deliver mail. / But I suspect he shall not / this soppy, stormy, Sunday.

23:01 gwern> (with the past poets / I share this yellow spring moon, / this beautiful night, / but this is the floating world - / and how many moons yet left?)

21:38 gwern> 'pity the mailman / for hell and high water rise / on his route today / but somewhere he is smiling / because today is Sunday'
21:39 gwern> 'Pity the mailman, / for hell and high water rise / bar his route today? / Yet somewhere he is smiling, / because today is Sunday.' meh. I like the idea but can't get it to work
21:39 gwern> 'Pity the mailman, / for hell and high water rising, / bar his route today? / Yet somewhere he is smiling / because - today is Sunday.' I suppose it's a decent enough senryu
00:04 gwern> 'Water raising moon / into the sky as of old... / And they felt this too? / - all symbols are reflections. / They wept for it, for themselves.'

19:02 gwern> two bunnies huddle / under the gentle spring rain / on the rolling lawn. / perhaps the cat is away / - and they are finally free'

21:52 gwern> the fourth of july / dawns rainy and nubilous / but in the darkness / we can watch the fireworks / of fireflies in the trees

Even the stars fade / into the sky's ink-darkness / and along the road / the wind and I walk as we / ponder the way of the world

were we the mayflies
or the eternal Buddha
without thought nor end
we should not need to sorrow
as cherry blossoms go by
